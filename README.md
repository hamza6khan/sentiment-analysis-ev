# Sentiment Analysis on News Sources Regarding Electric Vehicles

## Research Question
Is there a difference in average sentiment between different news sources regarding the topic of electric vehicles?â€‹

## Methods Used
* Sentiment Analysis (AFINN Lexicon in R)
* Welch's T-test
* Logistic Regression
* Data Visualization

## Project Description
In light of the growing significance of electric vehicles (EVs) as a prominent subject in business, politics, the environment, and consumer discussions, our group has undertaken a project to examine how media disseminates pertinent information on this matter. Recognizing the divisive nature of the issue, our aim is to investigate whether various sources present information that is either supportive of or opposed to the adoption of electric vehicles.

## Data Used
There wasn't a readily available dataset that could be used to answer this question. As such, we had to collect our own data. We used this [media bias chart](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-chart) to identify nine news sources, three for each lean (left, center and right). For each news source, we collected data from 10 articles. We copied and pasted each article text into a [.csv file](https://github.com/hamza6khan/sentiment-analysis-ev/blob/main/ling_460_project_data.csv) along with their link, and more.

## Limitations
Due to time constraints, we weren't able to collect a large amount of data, which could help increase the validity of our results.

## Conclusion
Through comparing average sentiments and utilizing Welch's t-tests, we were able to find statistically significant results that revealed the following results:
* Left-leaning news sources are the most positive regarding electric vehicles
* Right-leaning news sources are the most negative regarding electric vehicles
* Center-leaning news sources vary in sentiment, but are mainly neutral
