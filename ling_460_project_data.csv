And depending on where you live, your state will also knock thousands of dollars off the sticker price? And if you’re really lucky, your power utility might offer up to a $6,000 rebate as well? With the supply chain shocks of the Covid-19 pandemic wearing off and a fresh buffet of juicy enticements, a used EV right now can be one of the best bargains on the road, especially if you can pay cash. That is, if you can get your hands on one, and if your dealer knows about all the perks. “Overall, used EVs can actually be a pretty good deal for consumers because someone else has already taken the biggest hit on the depreciation of that vehicle,” said Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst at Consumer Reports. “But they still deliver the same fuel savings and can maybe even often offer greater maintenance and repair savings over time compared to a used gasoline vehicle.” As some buyers have learned, however, sellers don’t always know about all the sweeteners available. “The Hyundai dealership knew next to nothing about the car,” said Jeremy Conrad, who bought a 2019 Hyundai Ioniq plug-in hybrid car earlier this year in Pennsylvania. “They didn’t even know if there was a tax credit. I had to show them the list of eligible used cars on the government’s website, and even then they said to check with whoever does my taxes to ask about the tax credit.” Joseph Wall ran into the same problem buying a used Chevrolet Bolt in North Carolina. “My local CarMax had no idea about the used EV tax credit,” he said. “I had to talk to the business manager who asked corporate and got informed on it that way.” Confusion around tax credits is just one of several speed bumps ahead of buying used EVs, even as new electric car sales are accelerating. About one in 10 new cars sold last year around the world was electric. But to truly graduate from a luxury bauble to a reliable workhorse and to shift light-duty vehicles off of fossil fuels, electrics have to take over the used car market. This transition is also critical for the US strategy to limit climate change: Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country, and light-duty vehicles comprise 57 percent of this sector’s carbon dioxide output. The average car stays on the road for 12 years, so for EVs to win the race to decarbonization, they need to outrun the existing fleet on cost and performance. However, even as carmakers are offering more electrics in their lineups, they’re also making them bigger and more expensive. The average new electric car cost $66,000 last year, compared to the overall average new car at $48,000. Some EVs are now so pricey that they don’t qualify for tax credits. The IRS set a price cap of $80,000 for new electric vans, trucks, and SUVs and a $55,000 limit for all other vehicles. For used electrics, the ceiling is $25,000. And many new car buyers don’t need the help. According to J.D. Power, two-thirds of plug-in hybrid and battery EV owners earn more than $100,000. The key to starting the engine of electrification and revving up EV market share is to help people buy more used EVs. Americans purchase roughly 17 million new cars each year and 40 million used cars. The used EV market poised to become massive too, as new cars diffuse into secondhand car lots. “Even expensive new cars become affordable used cars,” Harto said. “It’s just a matter of time.” Right now, though, used EVs currently make up a tiny fraction of total car sales. Of the 250 million light-duty vehicles on the road in the US — cars, minivans, SUVs, and light trucks — only around 1 percent is electric. The majority of EVs are still in the driveways of their first owners. Drivers bought more than 42,000 used EVs at dealerships last year, but most car dealers don’t have any electric offerings on their lots, new or used. So if you’re in the market for a pre-owned electric car, it can be tricky to find one, to take advantage of the tax breaks, and to figure out whether the car is reliable. But experts have some tips to make sure you’re getting the best deal, and there are strategies to make more EVs available on used car lots. The used EV market is volatile, but it’s beginning to settle down While used EVs are a tiny market right now, they aren’t new. The Tesla Model S is now in its 11th year of production and its earliest generations are in the hands of second or third owners. However, the electric car market has gone through some wild swings. During the Covid-19 pandemic, some buyers actually managed to sell used EVs for more than the new sticker price. But prices have begun to fall over the past few months, including for popular electrics like the Tesla Model 3, the Toyota Prius Prime, the Hyundai Ioniq, and the Nissan Leaf. With interest rates rising, however, it’s now more costly to get a loan to buy a car, new or used, so cash buyers have an advantage. Another concern is how EVs fare in the real world over a long time. In terms of reliability, used EVs have a big advantage over internal combustion engines because they have fewer mechanical parts. There’s less that can go wrong, reducing the rising upkeep costs often associated with older cars. The big, unique maintenance worry with EVs and plug-in hybrids is the battery. Although they’re increasingly sophisticated, EV batteries, like all batteries, lose capacity over time and can wear out faster with extensive fast-charging. That, in turn, can eat into the overall range of the car. Replacing the battery can cost half the sticker price of an EV — if not more. Battery range worries can dissuade some buyers, but aside from a few high-profile recalls, most EV batteries have proven quite durable. Recurrent, a research firm that studies the performance of EVs, tracked the performance of more than 15,000 of these vehicles in the real world, looking at how their range changed over time as a proxy for battery health. “We’ve been really surprised to see how well most batteries are holding up,” said Liz Najman, lead researcher at Recurrent. “Most cars still have 85 to 90 percent of their original battery capacity.” Battery replacements actually tend to be pretty rare. At the same time, many manufacturers offer far more generous warranties for electric components than they do for combustion systems. Ford, for instance, offers a warranty for five years or 60,000 miles on conventional drivetrains but raises it to eight years or 100,000 miles for electric drives. Chevrolet also offers an eight-year or 100,000-mile warranty on EV battery components. Tesla’s battery warranty starts at 100,000 miles or eight years. These warranties are usually transferable when the vehicle is resold. That can offer buyers some peace of mind. “To be as covered as possible in a used car, I targeted the Bolt EV specifically because it would get a new eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty with the battery replacement,” said Wall. But many other drivers are still anxious about battery performance over time, according to Najman. “I don’t think there’s a ton of awareness of how long these battery warranties are,” she said. In fact, despite the more robust warranties, EVs tend to have lower resale values than conventional cars, according to Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book. After 36 months, an electric car retains about 63 percent of its value, compared to 66 percent for an internal combustion engine. “But when you go out to five years, an internal combustion engine car would retain 46 percent of its value, while the electric car would only retain 37 percent of its value,” Moody said. For most EVs, that’s well within manufacturers’ warranties. It’s not clear why there’s such a big gap. One factor could be that used car buyers at lower incomes are also less likely to have chargers at home, meaning they would have to rely on the fledgling public charging system. In many areas, these chargers can be sparse and unreliable. That’s one reason why plug-in hybrids are in such demand among used car buyers, even as manufacturers are moving away from them. That includes Conrad, who bought a plug-in Ioniq. “I regularly drive 180 to 200 mile round trips on the weekend, and I worried that especially in the winter an older EV might not make the trip. And there aren’t many public charging stations in central Pennsylvania,” Conrad said. Over time, though, Kelley Blue Book’s Moody expects that electric vehicles will close the gap in resale values. Potential used EV buyers should look for cars and trucks that are lightly used, under warranty, and ideally certified pre-owned from a nearby dealer. The odometer reading isn’t as important as how the battery has been treated, since frequent fast-charging and extreme weather conditions tend to cause more wear than topping up slowly in a garage. “It’s not exactly about the miles only,” Moody said. “It’s about how the battery is charged and cared for up until that point.” How to take advantage of tax breaks for used EVs Tax breaks and discounts can help close the equity gap for cleaner cars and direct the benefits to where they’re needed the most. For instance, EVs lead to near-term air quality improvements. That’s a huge upside for low-income people, especially if they live in areas that already suffer higher pollution. “The incentives for used vehicles are more important because that’s where more moderate-income and lower-income households enter the vehicle markets,” said Scott Hardman, a researcher at the Plug-in Hybrid & Electric Vehicle Research Center at UC Davis. “They will need help making this jump.” The trouble is that many dealers don’t know what’s out there, and the incentives change depending on your state, your income level, and your vehicle. The process proved so frustrating for Jonathan Seiden that he put together his own guide for used EV tax credits. He even created a template form for dealers to send to the IRS because he couldn’t find an official one from the government. “I was kind of shocked that no one had ever heard of it. Everyone was just saying ‘oh, you’re wrong, it’s only for new vehicles, it’s only for vehicles assembled in North America,’” said Seiden, who ended up buying a used Hyundai Ioniq in Virginia. “That caused me to kind of go down the rabbit hole of the IRS documentation around it.” To see if you’re eligible for a federal used EV tax credit, check the IRS’s list of qualifications and its list of eligible car models. The tax credit of up to $4,000 only applies to used EVs and plug-in hybrids that cost less than $25,000. Only joint filers making less than $150,000 or individuals making less than $75,000 can avail it. Since it’s a tax credit, if your tax bill is less than $4,000, you don’t get the full amount. And be sure to file Form 8936 with your returns. Next, check to see what state-level incentives are available and see if your power provider offers any discounts as well. Kelley Blue Book has a helpful list of what’s out there. The complicated economics of getting more EVs on the road EV prices are coming down for buyers, but that’s just a first step. Beyond lowering the sticker price for buyers, Hardman suggested it might be worth making subsidies more readily available for EV leases. Incentives tend to be a bigger factor for people who lease cars than those who buy them, and leased cars are typically held for three years before being resold. “That is quite a good way to increase the supply of used vehicles,” he said. Another hurdle to clear is car dealers. According to the Sierra Club, of the dealers they surveyed that didn’t sell any electrics last year, 45 percent said that they wouldn’t sell one even if they had the opportunity to do so. That’s due in part to the fact that dealers can generate up to half of their revenue with repairs and maintenance, something EVs don’t need as much. Many manufacturers also want dealerships to make expensive upgrades like installing fast chargers and training mechanics to work on EVs before they will give dealers a crack at selling electrics. That means the car-buying process needs to change. Manufacturers like Ford will let you search for dealers that are EV certified on their website and see their inventory online. All-electric companies like Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, and Polestar are trying to bypass dealers altogether and sell directly to customers, but some states still have laws that prevent direct-to-consumer purchases. Getting rid of these barriers could help these companies lower costs and reach more customers. It’s worth stepping back to remember why there’s such an interest in deploying electric cars and trucks to begin with: They’re a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. But they’re not always the most effective way of achieving this goal. “Our policies are currently not well-suited to maximizing the environmental value,” said David Rapson, a professor of economics at the University of California Davis who studies vehicle electrification. Incentives for used EVs are a case in point. They’re effectively a second subsidy for a single car, making them one of the more costly ways to curb emissions. “Maybe we want to make EVs more affordable in the used market, but the trade-off is we’re getting fewer carbon savings per dollar of subsidy spent when we do that,” said Rapson, who is also a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas. “An alternative policy that’s going to be much more effective from a carbon reduction perspective is putting a price on carbon.” Another tactic is to reduce the need to drive altogether. Better public transit and smaller electric vehicles like bicycles could yield more bang for the buck than EV subsidies. Electrifying government fleets like school buses and postal trucks can achieve higher economies of scale than private cars. Still, the majority of Americans drive to work every day and until there’s an alternative, there will be a massive market for EVs. The question is when electric cars will cross the tipping point where they’re cheap and abundant, with plenty of places to charge up and no more subsidies are required, creating a cycle that will ripple through the whole auto sector. So when EVs do finally take over the road, most drivers will be the second owner of their first electric car."
https://www.vox.com/technology/23713040/ev-car-dealer-dealership-electric-sales-gm-ford-tesla-rivian,Vox,left,Why most car dealers still don't have any electric vehicles,Umair Irfan,5/8/2023,"Electric cars and trucks are more popular than ever, and sales are growing, but if you want one, you’ll probably have a hard time finding an EV in stock near you. Two-thirds of US car dealers surveyed in a new Sierra Club study, published Monday, didn’t have any battery electric or plug-in hybrids for sale in 2022, new or used. “There are more dealerships that have electric vehicles since the last time we did this report [in 2019], but it’s still shockingly low,” said Katherine García, director of the Clean Transportation for All Campaign at the Sierra Club. Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, with passenger cars and trucks making up 57 percent of this share. So electrifying sedans, SUVs, and pickups is an essential component of the strategy for meeting climate change targets. The US has committed to cutting its total emissions in half from 2005 levels by 2030. Meanwhile, automakers like General Motors have committed to going all-electric, and there are looming bans on fossil fuel-powered cars in some of the largest car-buying states like California and New York. So what’s the holdup? A big part of it is due to supply chain blockages, with shortfalls in semiconductor and battery production preventing manufacturers from making enough electrics to meet demand. Some of the largest carmakers in the world — Honda, Toyota, Stellantis — had few if any EVs and plug-in hybrid models at all for sale in North America last year. According to the Sierra Club survey, 44 percent of car dealers who didn’t have an EV on their lots would gladly sell them if they could get their hands on one. “The larger bottleneck is with the manufacturers themselves,” García said. But 45 percent of dealers without EVs said they wouldn’t sell them even if they were available. The structure of the car sales model can put dealers, manufacturers, and customers at odds since the economics of EVs can disrupt the business model for dealerships. It’s another critical choke point: If a dealer is resistant to stocking electric cars and trucks, a buyer might not have any nearby options for the specific EV they want since manufacturers grant dealers monopolies in a given area. With the rise of all-electric carmakers like Tesla and Rivian, however, there’s a push for car companies to sell their vehicles directly to customers without the middleman. It’s forcing major auto companies and dealers to adapt and it will chart the route ahead for zero-emissions cars and trucks. Why car dealers matter so much for electric cars and trucks The EV buying experience varies a lot depending on what kind of car you’re looking for and where you are. Ninety percent of Mercedes-Benz dealers had an EV for sale compared to 11 percent of Honda retailers, according to the Sierra Club study. This includes used vehicles for sale that were made by another manufacturer. Your best bet for finding an EV on the lot was in the southeastern US in states like Georgia and Florida, where 41 percent of dealers had an electric for sale. In Western states like California, Oregon, and Washington, only 27 percent of dealers had EVs in stock. This region also accounted for 45 percent of EV sales in the US, so the lower stock was likely due to more demand. Some manufacturers are racing to keep up while also coping with recalls. Dealers in turn are adjusting to these sporadic supplies, but also trying to accommodate how EVs are changing the way they do business. All states have rules that encourage or require carmakers to sell vehicles to customers through dealerships. There are close to 17,000 franchise new car dealers in the US, and they sold 13.7 million light-duty vehicles last year, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. Originally, these regulations were designed to prevent a handful of major car companies from colluding across the country and fixing prices. Dealers also expanded the footprint of carmakers and gave buyers a local point of contact. They’re technically independent franchises, which means that they can set their own prices and incentives, but carmakers have a lot of leverage in how dealerships function. Vivek Astvansh, an assistant professor of marketing at Indiana University, explained that car dealers have three main functions: They sell cars and take trade-ins on behalf of the manufacturer, they provide loans to buyers, and they perform maintenance and repairs. It turns out that parts and service can account for nearly half of a dealership’s profits. But EVs don’t need oil changes, spark plugs, or valve checks. “All else equal, an electric car has fewer mechanical parts than a gasoline or diesel car, which directly means that the revenue a car dealer makes from an electric car is much lower than what the dealer will make from a gas or diesel counterpart,” said Astvansh. If there are any issues or recalls, many fixes for EVs can be applied over the air rather than going to a dealer. It’s a selling point for an EV buyer but a challenge for a dealer. “That is why they are hesitant to make a strong case for electric cars,” Astvansh said. On the other hand, many people are buying EVs for the first time and they’re counting on dealers to teach them the ins and outs of charging, maximizing range, and taking advantage of government incentives. As cars have become less mechanical, they’ve become more computerized, creating a learning curve for first-time drivers who may not appreciate the importance of keeping their car’s software updated, for example. “The foremost function that a dealer can provide is that of educating the buyers,” Astvansh said. “Customers cannot just use ChatGPT or Google and have all the information. They need to interact with a human being.” But dealers have to make investments in their infrastructure to sell EVs. Ford has created an EV certification program for its dealers, which requires them to build fast chargers and train their staff to work on electrics. The top-tier certification can cost a dealership up to $1.2 million to achieve, but it gives them first crack at new EVs and allocates them more inventory. Ford said that more than half of Ford dealers in the US have signed on as the company aims to build its own EV charging network. “It’s good for Ford; it’s just that the initial investment is expensive,” said Devron Stevenson, general manager of Banister Ford of Marlow Heights in Maryland. Stevenson said his dealership is gearing up to install level 3 fast chargers this year that can top up an EV in minutes, but require dedicated grid connections and specialized electrical hardware. Similarly, General Motors, the parent company of Chevrolet, is enacting standards for dealers. “For EVs, dealers must maintain the proper service tools, battery charging equipment, and training, as well as meeting customer experience standards,” said David Caldwell, a spokesperson for GM. “More than 90 percent of Chevrolet dealers are enrolled.” But even if manufacturers build them and dealers sell them, the trickier question is whether enough people will buy electric cars and trucks to make this all worthwhile. With borrowing costs increasing, EVs are a tougher sell since on average they have a higher sticker price than their fossil fuel counterparts. Earlier this month, Ford announced a price cut of up to 8 percent on its Mustang Mach-E. For dealers, how much they invest in EV infrastructure now is a delicate balancing act. “It’s going to depend: How fast can we get them? Can we afford them? Does it make sense overall in the next 24 months? To me, it’s a bit of a toss-up,” Stevenson said. What if you want to avoid the dealer altogether? Dealer franchise laws across the US benefit existing dealers but pose a problem for manufacturers that want to sell directly to their customers in some states. Tesla operates a factory in Texas, but the company can’t sell its cars to Texans directly. The cars have to be shipped out of the state before delivery to a Texas buyer. Other EV-only carmakers like Rivian and Lucid also sell directly to consumers. This doesn’t factor into the Sierra Club’s calculations, so EVs are more accessible to more people than the number of cars on lots lets on. EV companies say that this direct-to-consumer model lets them elide the haggling of traditional car dealers and avoid the costs of maintaining dealer lots and sales staff. Twenty-three states now allow direct sales for EV-only auto companies, though they they still face restrictions in many cases. Several more states are working on laws to make direct sales easier, either by relaxing rules or granting EV makers dealer licenses. Conventional automakers like Ford and Volkswagen have recently started to echo this, letting customers buy cars online and pick them up at a dealer rather than going through the sales process in person. Yet even EVs need to have their tires rotated, and all-electric companies are rushing to build out service centers to handle maintenance and recalls, or leaning on traditional automakers. “How important is convenient local service to customers? Since 2021, Tesla owners have come to GM dealerships for service on more than 11,000 occasions,” Caldwell said. He added that while EVs may not yet be available everywhere, the auto industry is making the largest and fastest technological change in its history. In 2020, electric cars and trucks accounted for 4.2 percent of new vehicle sales worldwide. In 2021, 8.3 percent. Last year, 14 percent. “Two words: It’s happening,” Caldwell said. "
https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/23583500/ev-electric-car-california-air-pollution-asthma-health,Vox,left,It doesn't take that many electric cars to improve public health,Umair Irfan,2/9/2023,"During his State of the Union address this week, President Joe Biden highlighted tax credits for EVs as a key plank in his strategy to corral climate change. Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, and electrifying cars and trucks is a key step in reducing their impact on the planet’s temperature. But switching from hydrocarbons to electrons has immediate benefits for the environment too, which in turn can improve public health. It makes sense that an electric car would lead to less air pollution than a car that burns gasoline. No engine, no combustion byproducts: carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, aldehydes, and so on. When inhaled, these chemicals can lead to high blood pressure, worsen emphysema, and trigger asthma attacks. Air pollution contributes to as many as 200,000 deaths per year in the United States. By some estimates, the health and economic benefits of avoided air pollution on their own are enough to justify the transition to clean energy. Swapping internal combustion cars and trucks for electric vehicles would lessen these health problems. And according to a new study, it doesn’t even take very many EVs to have a measurable benefit. A study published earlier this month in the journal Science of the Total Environment found that in California, every 20 zero-emissions vehicles per 1,000 people in a given zip code led to a 3.2 percent drop in the rate of emergency room visits due to asthma. What’s interesting here is that the researchers found this by studying actual air pollution levels and health outcomes rather than using models and simulations. These are not hypothetical benefits in the future; they’re happening now. “We really wanted to use real-world data, as real-world as possible, to see if we saw health impacts and air quality impacts,” said co-author Sandy Eckel, a biostatistician at the University of Southern California. Health is often framed as a co-benefit of the transition toward cleaner energy, but the study’s findings highlight how even for a massive global problem like climate change, some individual decisions can have an impact right away. The findings also showed, however, that EVs are an expensive way to address pollution and their benefits skew toward wealthier communities that can afford them. Often, that leaves communities with lesser means and more pollution in the dust. EVs can benefit your health, if you can afford them Eckel and her team looked at 1,200 zip codes across the Golden State between 2013 and 2019. They tracked electric vehicle registrations and local measurements of nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant produced by conventional engines that can cause breathing problems on its own and trigger the formation of other pollutants like ozone and particulate matter. The team controlled for long-term improvements in air quality. California has some of the strictest air quality rules in the US and has led the country in pushing cars and trucks to emit less, so pollution in general has declined over time. During the seven-year study period, the average number of zero-emissions vehicles per 1,000 people in a zip code increased from 1.4 to 14.7. As EV penetration grew, ER visits dropped. “This study adds to a strong body of research that we’ve already seen that shows the benefits of electric vehicles,” said Kathy Harris, senior advocate for clean vehicles at the Natural Resources Defense Council, who was not involved in the experiment. But EV adoption wasn’t spread evenly across the state. “There’s a lot of different social demographics there as well, and as part of the analytic approach, we did adjust for some influences of socioeconomic status,” said Erika Garcia, another co-author and a public health researcher at USC. In particular, the researchers looked at education levels, which served as a proxy for wealth in a community. Across California zip codes, the share of adults with at least a bachelor’s degree ranged from 1.1 percent to 87.1 percent. In communities with 17.1 percent of adults with bachelor’s degrees, the 25th percentile for education, the number of zero-emissions vehicles increased by 0.7 every year per 1,000 residents on average. At the 75 percentile for education, 47.2 percent of adults with bachelor’s degrees, the average annual increase in electric cars was 3.55, about five times higher. Higher educational attainment is strongly linked to higher incomes, which then make it easier to afford EVs. The average new car in the US last year cost around $48,000, while the average new electric car cost $66,000. Taken together, the findings reveal that the air quality improvements from switching to electric cars skew toward wealthier communities. That gap poses a tricky problem for public health because lower-income areas often face a higher baseline level of air pollution and its associated health problems. “It’s not surprising given how new technologies tend to infiltrate new populations,” said Garcia. “But it’s highlighting the need to ensure that these public health co-benefits are going to be distributed equally and equitably across the population.” Electric cars aren’t the only way to improve air quality Closing the EV adoption gap can pose a political challenge, however. Last November, California voters rejected a ballot measure that would raise taxes on wealthy residents to subsidize EVs for low-income and disadvantaged communities. But EVs aren’t the only route to reducing air pollution, and in many cases, they aren’t the best option. Electric cars and trucks are generally heavier than their gasoline counterparts, which can lead to more dust pollution from rubber and roads even as they eliminate exhaust pollution. Some of the largest EVs are actually worse for the climate than smaller combustion vehicles. Giant SUVs like the Hummer EV require more energy to move. Since the bulk of the US power grid still runs on fossil fuels, the carbon footprint of a big EV per mile can be larger than that of a tiny gasoline car. So spreading the benefits of improved air quality to the most vulnerable people requires looking beyond the tailpipes of personal cars, Harris said. Electrifying public transportation, trucks, and fleet vehicles, which are often routed through low-income communities, are also important tactics. And making it easier to live without a car at all might yield the biggest health benefits. Last year, the California legislature passed a $1,000 tax credit for low-income residents who don’t own a car. Still, EVs are charging ahead. In 2022, they accounted for 5.8 percent of new vehicle sales in the United States, up from 3.1 percent in 2021. California, the largest car market in the country, has already committed to ending the sales of all fossil-fuel powered vehicles by 2035. Major manufacturers like General Motors have committed to going all-electric while a new crop of full-electric carmakers is starting to emerge. These shifts will eventually trickle down to those with less money, but to save more lives, the transition will have to speed up."
https://www.vox.com/recode/2023/1/12/23550948/acceleration-cold-weather-tesla-ford-150-electric-vehicle-transition,Vox,left,5 unintended consequences of the EV revolution,Rebecca Heilweil,1/12/2023,"The world around us was built to cater to gas-powered cars. Tank trucks carrying thousands of gallons of fuel are a near-ubiquitous presence on the highway. Auto repair shops are stocked with drain pans and wrenches for oil changes. Gas prices are a central focus in politics. Even pedestrians and cyclists depend on the hum of the internal combustion engine — it’s a powerful audio signal that a car might cross their path. That’s all about to change. In the next few years, electric vehicles will replace many cars with internal combustion engines, and the White House has called for half of new vehicles to be electric by the end of the decade. This transition is a critical part of adapting to climate change, since EVs don’t produce tailpipe emissions and will reduce the world’s dependence on fossil fuels. But electric cars will also be an awkward fit for today’s transportation infrastructure, and not just because gas stations might one day go the way of horse stables. “Modern American cities bear a powerful physical imprint of automobiles and other motorized vehicles,” urban historian Martin V. Melosi wrote for the University of Michigan project Automobile in American Life and Society. “It is estimated that as much as one half of a modern American city’s land area is dedicated to streets and roads, parking lots, service stations, driveways, signals and traffic signs, automobile-oriented businesses, car dealerships, and more.” EVs really are a new kind of vehicle, armed with powerful sensors and even more powerful computers. They come with all sorts of surprising quirks, like brakes that require less maintenance. EVs can also accelerate extremely quickly, and they don’t make much noise, so if you’re a parent who relies on late-night drives and the sound of an engine to soothe your baby to sleep, you might need a new strategy. EV batteries present their own unique weather challenges, especially during hurricanes when saltwater floods can exacerbate the risk of a fire. None of these changes mean EVs are bad. They just reflect how tailored our roads, our cities, our cars, and even our personal driving habits are to internal combustion technology. While the biggest change coming to cars in the electric era is the arrival of the half-ton batteries we’ll use to power them, lots of smaller adjustments will also need to take place. Noise At high speeds, car tires rubbing against the road produce a lot of noise, which is one of the main reasons highways seem so loud. But in city environments, or when vehicles are driving at low speeds, the hum of an engine is the primary sound we associate with cars. Because EVs have fewer moving parts, however, they’re pretty quiet. As a result, EVs could help us cut down on noise pollution, which could boost our sleep quality and health. There’s a twist, though. When you’re walking or biking in a city, you often rely on these engine sounds to sense when it’s safe to cross. For this reason, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) requires that hybrid and electric cars make “warning” sounds when driving at low speeds. Auto manufacturers have even played around with creating new sound effects for cars. Nissan created its own “lullaby” that’s meant to get babies to fall asleep, and Tesla controversially released a feature that momentarily allowed users to emit fart noises from their vehicles. That Tesla feature was eventually recalled, and the NHTSA recently decided that consumers shouldn’t get to choose their cars’ sound effects. Weight Due to their batteries, electric vehicles can weigh hundreds of pounds more than their gas-powered counterparts. Automakers are looking at ways to mitigate this problem, like incorporating batteries into the structure of the vehicle. In the meantime, those extra pounds can create a dangerous situation. While they’re better at protecting people inside them, heavier cars are far more dangerous for pedestrians and passengers in other vehicles. Car crashes are already a major public safety crisis, and are responsible for about as many deaths as guns in the United States. Cars were already getting heavier before the EV revolution. The Environmental Protection Agency found that the average weight of new vehicles has increased by about 1,000 pounds since the 1980s. An influx of heavier EVs won’t help, and now there’s a big debate over what to do with current road weight limits. It doesn’t help that America’s highways are also in desperate need of repair, or that companies like GM and Ford are doubling down on marketing their extra-big electric trucks. Weather As with phone batteries, the chemical reactions that power the lithium-ion batteries in cars slow down in lower temperatures. Making matters worse is that the battery is often doing double duty heating the inside of the car’s cabin. You can definitely still drive your car in the cold weather, but some suggest using a car with a heat pump. There are other weather concerns. In the aftermath of hurricanes, EV batteries can end up submerged in saltwater, which is particularly conductive for electricity. This raises the risk that the battery ignites and starts a fire, which is what happened to several EVs in Florida during Hurricane Ian. While EV fires are incredibly serious, they’re less common than internal combustion vehicle fires, which don’t get as much media coverage. Speed EVs are changing the mechanics of driving a car — namely through extreme acceleration. While gas-powered cars have to wait on power to travel through the drive train before hitting the wheels, EV motors send that power straight to the wheels. A Tesla Model S, for example, can reach 60 miles per hour in just under 2.5 seconds. When we drive, we implicitly factor in how long it takes for our car to speed up, and being faster off the line, EVs will take some getting used to. Pedestrians and cyclists make similar calculations when they estimate how long they have to cross a street — or make a turn — based on how far away the nearest vehicle seems to be. That super-fast acceleration means we may need to become a lot more cautious when navigating the road. Accidentally hitting the wrong pedal will also get significantly more dangerous. Maintenance and repair Not only do EVs generally need less maintenance and fewer repairs, they also tend to be highly computerized. That means they can often be fixed via over-the-air downloads, a process that’s usually simple as updating the operating system on your phone. But the rise of EVs will inevitably mean the advent of new kinds of car repair issues, if only because mechanics who are trained to work with batteries are currently in short supply. EVs’ dependency on software, which is used in everything from AI-powered lane assistance to monitoring the health of a battery, is another double-edged sword. While it’s easier to download a software fix than it is to take a car in for repair, a surge in over-the-air updates may also increase the likelihood of new bugs, creating additional problems you didn’t have before. In November, for example, Tesla had to recall — which means updating the software for— 40,000 cars because of a power steering problem created by a firmware update that was released only a month earlier. It’s important to remember that internal combustion cars have plenty of flaws, too. EVs will eliminate many of them. But they’ll create some new challenges, which means we’ll also have to learn how to shift gears. "
https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23380905/electric-vehicles-ev-tesla-general-motors-transition-biden,Vox,left,Under the hood of the electric vehicle revolution,Rebecca Heilweil,10/24/2022,"he battery packs arrive at the General Motors plant in Lake Orion, a tiny village 30 miles north of Detroit, in large capsules. Amid the clanks and clunks of the assembly floor, workers pry the capsules open before robotic buggies shuttle them away, guided by magnetic tape that trails along the ground. Eventually, they arrive underneath what amounts to an overhead conveyor belt, a miles-long industrial track that carries scores of half-built Chevrolet Bolt EVs across the factory. Then, stretching upward like an accordion, machinery lifts the batteries up into the bottom of the vehicles’ frames, where, finally, a worker can bolt them together. This is what the great electric vehicle transition looks like on the assembly line. A few years ago, things would have worked very differently at the Orion Assembly plant, which first opened back in 1983. The conveyor system would have carried different models, like the Chevy Sonic and Buick Verano — internal combustion vehicles that GM has since discontinued. There would have been a fluid fill station, where workers used to put a small amount of fuel into new cars’ tanks. Today, the gas pump is gone, and there’s an adjusted line for installing electric propulsion parts, rather than gas-powered engines. GM was the first of the Big Three automakers to commit to going fully electric, and the company is now racing to meet surging demand for new EVs. Orion Assembly is the first internal combustion facility that GM repurposed to exclusively assemble green cars. The plant currently makes the Chevy Bolt EV, a hatchback that will start at $26,595 for the 2023 model, and the slightly larger, slightly more expensive Chevy Bolt EUV. Four car bodies on an assembly line awaiting interior fixtures. Chevy Bolt EVs in beginning production stages are seen at Orion Assembly, a General Motors vehicle assembly plant in Lake Orion, Michigan, on September 14. “Changing over to an EV from an internal combustion engine vehicle, you’re really just changing the propulsion system,” said Ken Morris, GM’s vice president of electric, autonomous, and fuel cell programs. “It’s the same type of historical parts that we’ve always used. The seats are the seats and the tires are the tires. The body structure is integrated differently because we’re attaching a battery pack.” Replacing gas engines with 1,000-pound batteries is a pretty significant update. Still, longtime automakers seem to be in search of an EV revolution that requires as little change as possible, at least from a manufacturing perspective. They want to use the factories they already have and stick with the models that their customers are already familiar with. (For example, to much fanfare, Ford started shipping an electric version of its popular F-150 pickup earlier this year.) But the future of American auto manufacturing won’t look anything like its past. This switch will be a major transformation for the auto industry, creating new winners and losers, political tensions, and a range of open questions. Unions and the state of Michigan, for instance, were the centerpiece of America’s internal combustion age, but that’s already far from the case in the still-nascent EV era. Motor City, meet Silicon Valley EVs have given the Orion plant a second life. Built during a slump in Michigan’s auto industry, Orion Assembly was supposed to signal that things were finally turning around. With machinery that included nearly 140 high-tech robots, GM hoped the plant would mark a new era in manufacturing automation. When President Ronald Reagan spoke at the plant’s dedication ceremony in 1984, he declared the site an “admirable commitment to the future of America.” Orion Assembly started out producing Cadillac models, but over the course of several decades, it made everything from the Oldsmobile Aurora to the Pontiac Bonneville. Then, in early 2014, a group of workers at the plant was brought on to work on a secret project. Marland “Lanny” Brown, a Michigan native who’s spent decades working at the Orion facility, was part of that team, and he eventually flew to South Korea to learn about a new electric vehicle concept GM had been developing in collaboration with electronics manufacturer LG. A man standing and smiling inside a car assembly plant. Marland “Lanny” Brown has worked at Orion Assembly for decades and was one of the first to begin working on the transition to electric vehicles at the plant. “There are more electrical components in this car. This car is run more by modules and controls,” Brown explained on a recent visit to the Orion plant. “Because of the voltage and everything that’s involved, it was a whole different concept.” After GM announced that it would start production on its Chevy Bolt EV in 2015, the company spent $160 million on new equipment, tooling, and build cells for Orion Assembly. To make the transition, GM repurposed space on the floor once used for gas tank installation and started training workers on how to handle new electrical components. Still, Brown said, much of the facility’s approach has remained the same. Like earlier internal combustion vehicles, the Chevy Bolt frame is welded together by robots, and another team of robots paints the vehicle. Once equipment like weather stripping and seats are added, the half-built car is carried by the conveyance system to a special area, where the battery is finally installed. While the assembly of the body of EVs is relatively similar to that of gas-powered cars, building internal combustion engines is nothing like building EV powertrains. Fossil fuel engines require a complex array of machinery, such as metal castings and several gears, while EVs generally don’t need geared transmissions or engines. Manufacturing the batteries that power these motors often takes place at a different facility, and involves turning refined materials like lithium, graphite, and cobalt into battery cells. These cells package together components like anodes, cathodes, and electrolytes into flat pouches, thousands of which are then packed into bigger modules, and then into the final half-ton battery pack. Dozens of Chevy Bolt EV vehicles move through the assembly line at Orion Assembly. EV batteries can be dangerous, too. The liquid electrolyte in the lithium-ion batteries typically used for electric vehicles is extremely flammable. When a battery is damaged or has a defect, this electrolyte can ignite, heating the battery uncontrollably. So while EV fires occur far less often than internal combustion vehicle fires, they tend to be more severe and last longer. Defects in the Chevy Bolt battery made the car particularly prone to this problem. After a series of Chevy Bolts spontaneously burst into flames, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration started issuing recalls, and even told Chevy Bolt owners not to park near other cars. By 2021, GM had recalled every Bolt ever produced. Retooling the battery forced Orion Assembly to shut down, and it only resumed production this past April. Nevertheless, GM is moving forward with its EV ambitions. As part of a $4 billion expansion announced in January, Orion will soon add two new trucks to its roster: electric versions of the GMC Sierra and the Chevy Silverado. To boost its production capacity, new paint and body shops and a new battery facility will be built along the sides of the current plant — a massive construction project. In September, GM said that it would spend $760 million to upgrade an internal combustion propulsion plant in Toledo, Ohio, to build drive units for electric trucks, and another $491 million to retrofit a facility in Indiana to make steel and aluminum parts for future cars, including EVs. GM also recently renovated a factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to build electric Cadillacs. GM’s competitors are taking a similar tack. Stellantis, the company that owns brands like Jeep and Chrysler, is spending billions to retrofit factories everywhere from Canada to Serbia for EV manufacturing. Some startups have taken the same approach: This year, Rivian opened an EV factory at a former Mitsubishi plant in Illinois that shut down in 2016. This is all in an effort to catch up with Tesla, which produced nearly 70 percent of the new EVs registered in the US last year and is usually the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer, depending on the quarter. The emerging EV workforce From Tesla’s perspective, the future of American-made cars isn’t in Detroit, and it doesn’t involve unions. The company was founded in San Carlos, California, and is headquartered in Austin, Texas, many states away from Michigan. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made no secret that he’s opposed to labor organizing. He’s even dared the United Auto Workers (UAW), the national union that represents most car workers, to hold a unionization vote at one of his factories. There’s a different attitude at Orion Assembly, where more than 1,000 workers are members of Local 5960, the plant’s chapter of the UAW, and union swag is a fixture on the factory floor. For the Orion union branch, the EV transition has meant the promise of more jobs and an expansion that will approximately triple the number of people working at the facility. Workers standing on the ground work on cars in an assembly line suspended over their heads. Assembly workers tend to Chevy Bolt EV vehicles on an assembly line. But UAW leadership is cautious about the big pivot to electric vehicles. Automakers have made no secret of the fact that the EV age may require a smaller labor force. Electric vehicles have fewer overall parts than internal combustion vehicles and may need less work to put together. Ford said in August that it would cut 3,000 positions amid the transition, and the CEO of Volkswagen has said that the shift could eventually mean losing as many as 30,000 jobs at his company. There’s also concern that automakers could use the switch to EVs to open more plants outside of Michigan, including in Southern states that aren’t as union-friendly. “A lot of the work that has been done in the past has been done with, essentially, contract workers there,” said Keith Cooley, who worked at GM for 25 years and is now president and CEO of Principia, which focuses on the clean economy. “Many of those contract workers are people of color and do not have the same rate of migration into working for the company itself or working for the union.” The Department of Labor told Recode that, over the next decade, jobs in vehicle manufacturing are expected grow somewhat faster than the overall economy, while jobs in auto parts manufacturing will grow at a much slower rate. Still, auto workers involved in an MIT-funded study said that they’re worried about a wide range of issues with the EV transition, including fears that EVs won’t be a hit with consumers and concerns that companies will shut down the internal combustion facilities where they work and leave them behind. Many of the workers don’t have the confidence in EVs that managers and executives do, according to Sanya Carley, an Indiana University professor who worked on the MIT project. “We believe the transition to electric vehicles will happen, but it must not happen at the expense of current members making [internal combustion engine] vehicles,” UAW president Ray Curry said in a statement. “The transition to EVs will not happen overnight. We are at a moment where we can change the supply chain model for the next generation of vehicles to have more parts built here with good union wages.” New and retrofitted EV plants can also create severe environmental hazards and pollution — including emissions and noxious odors — especially for communities who live nearby. One of the clearest examples is the Stellantis Mack Assembly plant, which is located in a majority-Black neighborhood on Detroit’s east side. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is investigating whether the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy racially discriminated when it decided where to approve the new plant. This is after that state agency flagged the Stellantis plant for several air quality violations. Auto workers are also worried that car companies will prioritize their growing number of software engineers over the people who work at assembly and other manufacturing plants. As cars have gone electric and gained increasingly autonomous features, they’ve also turned into sophisticated electronic devices powered by millions of lines of code. As a result, there’s fear that carmaking could eventually look a lot less like the production line at Orion and a lot more like desk work, and even remote desk work. GM currently has at least 10,000 people working on software and more than 500 people focused on cybersecurity. “This process is happening across the board, but that demand for continuous software talent is going to grow. Because now, not only the technology companies are going after them, the automotive companies are also going after them,” said Padma Sundaram, the director of software-defined vehicles at GM. The new politics of EVs This is only the beginning of the EV transition. Plants like Orion Assembly are already struggling to produce enough cars and trucks to meet consumer demand, and new incentive programs from state and federal governments promise to encourage even more Americans to ditch their fossil fuel vehicles. That’s why President Joe Biden and a gaggle of other high-profile Democrats, including Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, made appearances at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit last month. For the White House, the choice to attend was simple political math. It was the first in-person Detroit auto show since 2019, and the car industry, union leadership, and throngs of startups were gathering to celebrate one of America’s biggest industries just a few weeks before midterms in a swing state. And in the halls of Huntington Place in downtown Detroit, which was filled with new electric cars and trucks as well as futuristic charging tech, Biden’s vision for the American EV industry seemed all but inevitable. “As I met with the CEOs of the different traditional automakers in Detroit, one of the things they made very clear to me is that they are all-in, to the extent that they’re taking actually big risks as businesses: depending on the national environment to continue favoring electric,” Buttigieg told Recode in a recent interview, “because they’ve passed some points of no return.” But the new politics of electric vehicles are tricky on both the state and national level. Michigan politicians on both sides of the aisle see the rise of EV manufacturing as a potential renaissance for the state’s auto industry, as well as for the communities and workers that depend on it. State politicians have pushed for the opening of new plants, and local governments have wooed companies with enticing tax advantages. In Lake Orion, for example, the local township has awarded GM a 12-year, $1.3 billion tax abatement to expand its facilities there. Gov. Whitmer has pushed for incentives for more companies to build EV factories, though she’s also faced criticism from Michigan Republicans who argue that her efforts haven’t stopped automakers from building new EV factories in other states. Indeed, the auto industry has been expanding from Michigan to other parts of the country for years. And Biden’s big campaign to boost American-made EVs doesn’t necessarily mean those vehicles will be made in Michigan. “Michigan’s auto workers are the best in the business, but different states and different countries are going to be competing for these kinds of major investments,” Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), whose district includes Lake Orion, told Recode. “The US is going to have to compete with China and other countries with much looser wage and labor laws.” Just like Michigan, New York, Georgia, Kentucky, and North Carolina have all offered tax breaks and grants to companies that build new EV, battery, and component factories in their respective states. Internationally, the US has dominated, and remains a major player, in the internal combustion market. But many countries, including Germany and Japan, are vying for that status in the EV era, which is still taking shape. For now, China currently produces many of the world’s electric vehicles, and last year, China was responsible for more than 70 percent of the world’s EV battery manufacturing, according to the International Energy Agency. EVs and the beginning of the future Back at Orion Assembly, there are already hints that yet another massive transformation for the auto industry is on the horizon. Most of the half-complete car frames, battery packs, and chassis traveling about the factory are destined to become Chevy Bolt EVs and EUVs — and they’ll play a key part in GM’s plan to produce 1 million zero-emission vehicles per year by 2025. But a small, select few are pulled aside for a rest stop, of sorts. At a station on the assembly floor, workers line the inside of the car frames with an intricate array of electronics, logging each addition on a special computer nearby. Cameras and sensors are eventually installed on the roof, transforming an EV into a self-driving car. This is the Cruise AV, the primary vehicle used by Cruise, GM’s autonomous vehicle subsidiary. A small fleet of these cars is currently traversing the streets of San Francisco, and they’ll begin tests in Austin and Phoenix in the coming months. To be clear, self-driving vehicles are still being developed — depending on who you ask, they could arrive somewhere between the next few years and the next few decades. In the meantime, the upcoming surge in EV manufacturing is still a big bet, and it’s predicated on the idea that people will buy them, and buy them in droves. But while EV sales have accelerated, they’re around just 5 percent of the new cars people are buying in the US right now, and many consumers remain cautious. For automakers, this reality means marketing an EV future to workers and customers while continuing to operate and profit in the still mostly gas-powered present. “They can convert their factories over,” explains Brett Smith, the technology director at the Center for Automotive Research. “But what makes it really challenging is that they have to do it while still trying to figure out how to build internal combustion engine cars.” A Chevy Bolt makes its way down the assembly line at Orion Assembly. How many people will buy EVs remains unclear and, to some extent, hinges on how much automakers can make the new seem as convenient, affordable, and exciting as the old. That could be tough. Lanny Brown, the longtime Orion employee who worked on the Chevy Bolt core team, has only positive things to say about driving EVs, and he says they’re perfect for commuters. Brown personally has no plans to get one, though, since he’s nearing retirement. “I live quite a ways from here,” he said. “And I’m lining up to buy my last truck.” "
https://www.vox.com/recode/23333356/ev-electric-vehicle-self-driving-cars-internal-combustion-driving,Vox,left,It's the end of the car as we know it,Rebecca Heilweil,9/2/2022,"Cars changed the world, and not just by making it easier to get around. These vehicles have shaped everything from how fast we can travel to the way we design cities. But now, more than a century after it was first invented, the car is facing a reckoning. The key technology behind most passenger vehicles — the fossil fuel-powered internal combustion engine — takes a devastating toll on the environment. Cars account for more than half of transportation’s overall greenhouse gas emissions, emitting tailpipe pollutants that hurt local air quality and contribute to climate change. These vehicles pose an immediate physical threat to the people in or around them, too: Car accidents in the United States kill about as many people as firearms do, and more than a million deaths occur on roadways each year worldwide. With the rise of the car has also come the rise of car-centric infrastructure — infrastructure that’s contributed to racist, classist, and socially isolating urban design choices, all at the expense of investment in public transportation. Internal combustion engine vehicles remain the dominant way of getting around the US, and they represent the lion’s share of the new cars sold today. Still, there’s evidence that these vehicles may be reaching the end of their road. A new generation of electric vehicles can not only cut down on carbon emissions, they’re also easier to drive and maintain. While EVs make up just 3 percent of new vehicles in the US right now, the government is investing billions of dollars to encourage more people to buy them. These efforts include funding a nationwide charging network and developing an American supply chain for EVs through the Inflation Reduction Act’s revamped EV tax credit. President Joe Biden wants half of the new cars sold in the US to be electric by 2030. But cars are in the midst of a transformation that goes far beyond EVs, according to Bryan Appleyard, the author of The Car: The Rise and Fall of the Machine That Made the Modern World. The emergence of ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft has blurred the lines between owning a car for personal and professional reasons, and has also made it easier to avoid driving a car at all. The percentage of young people getting driver’s licenses has dropped nearly 20 percent since the 1980s, according to Federal Highway Administration data. At the same time, the advancement of artificial intelligence and computer vision has spurred the development of vehicles that are far more technologically sophisticated than their predecessors. Their next-generation software leaves much more of the driving experience in the hands of tech companies and programmers, and much less in the hands of individual car owners. Eventually, car companies hope to turn these vehicles into AI-powered machines that drive themselves. “Modern machines are in themselves useless,” Appleyard told Recode. “They have to be connected. There’s no point to a computer that’s not connected now. That connection is not yours — you don’t control it. Cars will be like that.” As Appleyard sees it, the end of the car as we know it may be on the horizon. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Rebecca Heilweil When the car first arrived, it was competing with the horse and carriage. Now, it’s essentially a computer that happens to have wheels. What’s next for the car? Bryan Appleyard The car began as a curiosity. People were astonished by it — and afraid of it — and then it gradually became a rich man’s plaything. The turning point was the Ford Model T, which became available to almost everybody. It was sold around the world. The next step was taken by General Motors and Alfred Sloan, who turned the car into a consumer object. What’s happened since is that the car just became almost not noticeable. It just became so part of the environment, where we just assumed lots of people had cars, they would get around in them, and that was that. I suspect that with the billions and possibly trillions of dollars going into self-driving cars in Silicon Valley, cars have basically moved from Detroit to Silicon Valley. They’ll come up with something eventually, although it’s proving more difficult than they thought. With the success of ride-hailing companies like Uber, we’re moving to a world in which the pleasure of the car itself and the internal combustion engine are going to be left behind. Rebecca Heilweil The vehicles of the future are going to be electric, but EVs themselves are just as old as international combustion vehicles. Why didn’t they take off when they were first invented? Bryan Appleyard There was no certainty that the internal combustion engine was going to win. There were steam cars and steam buses and so on, and there were electric cars. In 1900, only 20 percent of the 5,000 cars in the US were powered by petrol. The rest were electric or steam-powered. One of the things about steam cars is that they’re incredibly quick. One in Florida hit 127.7 miles an hour, which was unthinkable at the time. No petrol car came close to it. People were at home with steam because they were used to trains. An electric-powered cab with the driver at the back up top, circa 1900. Electric vehicles are as old as cars are. Bettmann Archive The electric car was more tricky. In marketing terms, it was marketed to women because it was seen as a more simple car, and women were regarded as simple creatures in those days. It was very rudimentary. It turned on a switch and it went, but they didn’t have the battery technologies that we have today, so the range was rather pathetic. Rebecca Heilweil Your book explains that when the car first showed up, it was seen as a luxury item. Then, it became more commonplace as manufacturing scaled up and prices came down. How is that story playing out with EVs? Bryan Appleyard The Nissan LEAF was Nissan’s guess of what an electric car should be. The guess was: It would be a small city car. It was a very successful car and very well made, but it was boring. Nobody’s gonna get a thrill out of driving in this LEAF. The genius of Elon Musk was that he saw that what would really launch the electric car was a really fast, exciting car. Musk successfully spotted that electric cars should not be boring and slow — that’s it. A small red electric car being driven past a wind farm. The EV1 was an early electric vehicle manufactured by GM in the 1990s. The EV1 that GM produced in the 1990s was a gem. Everybody loved it. It was a pure electric car, easy to drive, and it was perfect for going around town and so on. It was a remarkable achievement, and they did it because they thought it was the right thing to do. And then they changed their minds. They’d only leased the cars to people — they hadn’t sold them — so when they ended the leases, the owners were required to get them back. So the very good EV that General Motors made before everybody else just ended. They sort of dropped out of the race, and it was a fatal mistake. Rebecca Heilweil Now that EVs are going mainstream, what do you think will happen to all the infrastructure that was built to cater to the internal combustion vehicle? Bryan Appleyard The beauty of the internal combustion engine — that sort of electromechanical magic of the internal combustion engine — requires super-refined engineering. An electric motor is just an electric motor. It will destroy jobs, both in manufacturing and services because they don’t need much servicing. I suspect that the removal of petrol from the picture will also change things fundamentally. It will change the way the industry works, but also change the way the customer end of it works. Rebecca Heilweil As you said, the automotive industry is shifting from Detroit to Silicon Valley and taking jobs with it. What are the consequences of that? Bryan Appleyard Silicon Valley has taken over now. So why are they doing this? They’re doing this to grab another source of information, which is where you’re driving, how you’re driving, what you’re doing while you’re driving. Everybody says at the moment, though, they’re not going to make the self-driving car. But they’ll make it, and the question then becomes: How much do you care about your car? How much do you care about driving? People will care for an awfully long time, but will the next generation? Meanwhile, these ride-hailing services are transforming the world. For the first time ever, both in Britain and America, applications for driver’s licenses from young people are dropping. They don’t care. They don’t want a car. They don’t see the point of the expense, so they just hail rides all the time or rent a car for a day. Rebecca Heilweil In the future, will we own the cars that we drive? Bryan Appleyard If I buy this iPhone, its software is not mine. The software is controlled by the cloud. Just as with Tesla, Elon wants to pick the right thing and drop it into your car without you knowing anything about a piece of software. There’s a problem: Modern machines are in themselves useless. They have to be connected. There’s no point to a computer that’s not connected now. That connection is not yours — you don’t control it. Cars will be like that. Rebecca Heilweil Is this the end of the car, or at least, the car as we know it? Bryan Appleyard The horse is a magnificent thing and lasted for five or six thousand years as a trade animal. The car is the same thing. It was a wonderful, extraordinary thing. Now we’re finding fault with it. They changed the world more fundamentally than any other technology. Physically, they changed the world. "
https://www.vox.com/recode/23331223/electric-vehicles-biden-ev-inflation-reduction-act,Vox,left,Biden's long game for American-made electric vehicles,Rebecca Heilweil,9/1/2022,"Much hay has been made about how the Inflation Reduction Act represents America’s biggest climate investment ever. But reading between the lines of the legislation, which tackles everything from taxes to health care, shows that the nearly $740 billion law has some caveats, including new provisions to a more than decade-old EV tax credit. For years, prospective electric vehicle buyers could count on a federal vehicle tax credit, which amounts to a $7,500 discount on a wide range of EV models. The incentive was originally authorized in 2008 and played a critical part in promoting early EV startups and encouraging price-conscious consumers to take the plunge and go electric. The IRA extends the tax credit until 2032 and establishes an additional $4,000 credit for used EVs. But there are new rules, too, for a vehicle to qualify for that credit. The final assembly of any qualified vehicles must take place in North America, and the credit will also hinge on the vehicle’s size, its total cost, and potential buyers’ income. Starting before 2024, at least 40 percent of the critical minerals and at least half of the battery components used to build new eligible EVs will need to come from the US or one of its free trade partners to access the full credit. But for most consumers, the new tax credit could prove elusive. Around 70 percent of the electric, hydrogen, and hybrid cars currently sold in the US won’t be eligible for the credit, according to the Alliance of Automotive Innovation, a trade group that represents the car industry. An August analysis of the IRA proposal from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that only about 11,000 vehicles could receive the credit in 2023, and around 60,000 vehicles in 2024, according to an August analysis of the IRA proposal. While the Internal Revenue Service is charged with determining which vehicles are eligible, experts told Recode that they expect very few cars to receive the credit over the next several years, especially since the law’s sourcing requirements are designed to become more stringent. But that may not be the case forever. The tax credit is only one part of the Biden administration’s plan for a new era of American auto manufacturing, which includes everything from a new push to rethink mining regulations to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act’s $3 billion investment in the domestic battery supply chain. Together, these efforts, and a surge in new EV factories based in the US, could make American-made electric vehicles much more common in the latter part of the decade. At the same time, this credit won’t necessarily disincentivize people from buying EVs that are made abroad, especially as electric vehicle prices decline and as geopolitics continue to complicate the world’s access to fossil fuels. “People will still go ahead and purchase EVs that do not qualify for the tax credit,” explains Jane Nakano, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ energy security and climate change program. “EVs do have some real consumer benefits. It’s not just for decarbonization. It’s household economic benefits, and then to some extent, energy security benefits.” Right now, China is the undisputed world leader in EVs. Though the critical minerals used in electric vehicle batteries are currently sourced from all over the world –– the lion’s share of cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while lithium tends to come from South America and Australia — much of the processing of those materials takes place in China. China is also responsible for more than 70 percent of global battery cell production. The country not only makes much of the world’s battery components, like cathode materials, but is also home to the largest battery manufacturer, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. The overhauled vehicle tax credit aims to catch up and compete by putting increasing pressure on automakers, though they do get one major piece of help. The earlier version of the credit included a provision that after an automaker made 200,000 eligible vehicles, people could no longer claim the $7,500 credit. That means companies like Tesla and GM haven’t been able to offer the credit for some time. The latest version of the law eliminates that limitation, so car models built by larger EV manufacturers could become eligible for the credit once again. Car manufacturers will face an uphill battle in meeting those requirements, especially since the percentage of components and materials that must come from the US or its partners is designed to increase in the coming years. US reserves of minerals like cobalt, lithium, and nickel are just a small fraction of the world’s current supply. Even stricter rules will eventually kick in: By 2024, eligible vehicles can’t incorporate any battery components from China or other “foreign entities of concern,” and in 2025, they can’t include any critical minerals from these countries, either. “This is the very moment for those automakers to decide the next pathway of their business model and where they’re going to invest and shore up their production,” explains Katherine Stainken, the vice president of policy at the Electrification Coalition, an organization that promotes EV adoption. The US was making progress on this front even before Biden signed the IRA earlier this month. Automakers and electronics manufacturers have been slowly adding to the number of battery production facilities in the US over the past several years. Earlier this week, Honda and LG Energy Solution announced that they would build a $4 billion battery plant in the US, with mass production expected in 2025. Panasonic, which said it would open a battery factory in Kansas last month, now says it may build a second facility in Oklahoma. The Department of Energy estimated at the end of last year that at least 13 new gigafactories may be coming to the US, joining the several plants that companies like Tesla and GM have already opened. These efforts are buoyed by the Biden administration’s other investments in the tech supply chain. The White House has already appropriated funding from last year’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Act to support new projects focused on lithium production and critical mineral recycling, and the Department of Energy is loaning out billions to support the construction of new GM and LG Chem battery factories. The White House is also supporting an effort in Congress to overhaul the Mining Law of 1872, which still governs much of the mining within the US today. Biden declared the key metals used in EVs critical to national security when he invoked the Defense Production Act in April, setting the groundwork for the Department of Defense to boost the domestic mining industry. The CHIPS and Science Act could give American-made EVs a lift, too. The $52 billion package subsidy, which Biden formally approved earlier this summer, will subsidize the construction of several new semiconductor factories in the US, including plants focused on making automotive chips. This is especially important for EVs, which can easily require double the number of computer chips that comparable internal combustion vehicles do. “What the United States is doing right now is securing its own supply over the next 10 years,” explains Nathan Iyer, a senior associate at RMI, “and making sure that what currently is 0.7 percent of the global market goes up to a more reasonable amount, closer to 5, 6, 10, 13 percent of the global market, to really ensure that our own demand is being covered by supply chains.” Biden’s plan does have some real flaws, however. Federal mining applications and approvals have decreased over the past several years, and environmental regulations may stall the opening of new mining projects Critically, the prospect of building or expanding new mines introduced the risk of pollution, potential damage to agriculture and wildlife, and disproportionate impacts on local communities. In Minnesota, members of tribes who live nearby are already raising concerns about a mine from which Talon Metals, a company that has won a contract with Tesla and praise from the Biden administration, is planning to extract nickel for EVs. There are logistical hurdles as well. The IRS needs to figure out how to accurately determine which EV models meet the new credit’s tough sourcing requirements, a task the tax agency is not currently equipped for. Other countries, including the European Union and South Korea, have suggested that the clean vehicle tax credit may be unfair to foreign carmakers and could violate international trade rules. It’s also possible that automakers will accept a $7,500 markup to avoid the government’s new requirements entirely. These efforts are a reminder that even though the US has a long history of building cars, the country is mostly starting from scratch when it comes to electric vehicles. The investments the Biden administration is making in EV manufacturing capabilities largely won’t produce components or vehicles for at least several years, which means consumers may have to wait to reap the full benefits of the extended credit. Only time will tell whether Biden’s dreams for an EV renaissance for the American auto industry ultimately pan out. "
https://www.vox.com/recode/22969335/california-gm-electric-cars-power-grid-batteries-blackouts,Vox,left,California wants to use electric cars to back up the power grid,Neel Dhanesha,3/9/2022,"General Motors and Pacific Gas and Electric this week announced a joint pilot program to test ways GM’s electric vehicles could help the California utility’s customers keep the lights on, either by providing backup power to homes during blackouts or feeding energy back into the grid when demand is especially high. It’s a significant step towards enabling EVs to become big batteries on wheels. The idea behind the pilot is deceptively simple: An EV owner plugs their car into a charger at home, and instead of electricity simply flowing into the car’s battery, electricity can also flow out of it to provide power to buildings — a concept called “vehicle-to-grid,” which essentially makes the car an extension of the power grid itself. The most basic version of this idea entails temporarily cutting off a house from the power grid during a blackout so that the car can provide backup power; at a more advanced level, a collection of EVs working together can act like a large backup battery for the grid at large. In most of the country, the power grid isn’t set up for something like this (simply put, the car and the grid don’t know how to talk to each other). But with climate change hammering the aging American power grid, the PG&E pilot is a sign that utilities are starting to think creatively about potential solutions. As the home of one million (and counting) EVs — the most electric vehicles of any state in the country — California is particularly well-suited to test the concept of using EVs this way. Climate change is also exacerbating California’s wildfire problem, and PG&E warned customers in 2019 that they would be facing up to ten years of precautionary blackouts as the company tried to prevent fires started by its transmission lines. This is quite literally a life-or-death issue: PG&E was found responsible for sparking last year’s Dixie Fire, the second-largest fire in state history, and charged with manslaughter after its equipment started fires in 2018 and 2020. GM is by no means the only manufacturer thinking about vehicle-to-grid solutions, and in some ways it’s playing catch-up. Bidirectional charging — power flowing out of a car battery as well as into it — has been part of Ford’s marketing for its electric F-150 lightning since the truck was announced in May 2021, and PG&E previously worked with BMW to test ways EVs could support the grid. But experts say GM’s size and electric vehicle ambitions mean its pilot with PG&E has the potential to be a big deal, and could be the first real test case of the vehicle-to-grid idea. “Bidirectional power on a large scale hasn’t really been performed yet,” said Kyri Baker, an assistant professor of engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. “It’ll be a good case study to suss out any issues that might happen.” It’s also an indication of how serious GM, which announced it would end production of diesel and gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, is about electric vehicles. The company lost money on every Chevrolet Bolt it sold, and projects like the PG&E pilot don’t come cheap. “To see them put time and resources into a project makes me hopeful,” said Samantha Houston, a senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. She added that the vehicle-to-grid could, as a concept, be a little speedier. “I certainly think that utilities, given their scale, could go further faster if they wanted to,” Houston told Recode. “I’ve seen a bit of caution approaching these things because batteries on wheels are not something utilities have really worked on before.” Part of the issue is that the grid might not be ready for energy to flow in the opposite direction than it normally does. That means utility companies would probably need to invest in replacing components, like transformers, so they can handle power flowing in both directions. Powering a single home, however, is easier: The building would simply need to be wired in a way that shuts it off from the larger grid when it’s receiving power from the car, which is probably why the GM-PG&E pilot is focusing on home backup power. But this raises another problem: For your electric vehicle to power your home in a blackout, you need to be able to plug your car into your home — likely through a charger located in a garage or carport. There’s no good way to send power from public charging spots back into, say, an apartment, and it’s hard enough to figure out how to send energy from public chargers back into the grid at large. That inherently limits the benefits to people who have enough income to not only buy an electric vehicle but also live in a home with a garage. “It’s still a program that’s only accessible by a lot of high-income residents,” Baker explained. “It’s one thing to be able to afford an EV, and it’s another thing to be able to afford the extra equipment.” The consequences of climate change are inequitable, and economically disadvantaged communities are going to bear the brunt of the pain. It’s important, Baker and Houston said, that they don’t get left behind. “I think probably the next step is to ask ‘how do we make the transition to electric vehicles more equitable?’” Baker said. “We still don’t know how to do that."
https://www.vox.com/22463219/electric-vehicles-charging-station-infrastructure,Vox,left,The fastest way to get more people to buy electric vehicles,Ella Nilsen,6/4/2021,"Whether the United States can get to net-zero emissions by 2050 hinges hugely on our love of cars: They’re the dominant mode of transportation in America — ridership on trains, buses, and other public transit pales in comparison. Other transportation options are limited, and cars are ingrained in American culture. This makes switching to electric vehicles an attractive way to decarbonize. But in order to encourage more people to buy electric vehicles (EVs), the US needs a better charging station infrastructure. That is a key part of President Joe Biden’s American Jobs Plan, which proposes spending $174 billion on EVs, a sum that would boost supply chains for automakers, help subsidize the cost of cars for American drivers, and dramatically scale up the number of public electric vehicle charging stations along the nation’s roadways. There are currently about 42,490 public charging EV stations in the US, counting Level 2 chargers (taking about an hour of charging for 10 to 20 miles of range), and DC Fast chargers (taking about 20 minutes of charging for 60 to 80 miles of range). In comparison, there are about 115,000 gas stations in the US, most of which have multiple pumps. Biden’s plan would increase the number of charging stations more than tenfold by establishing grant and incentive programs for state and local governments and private companies to build 500,000 charging stations around America’s highways and in hard-to-reach communities by the year 2030. With a number of US carmakers pledging to go totally electric by 2035, that buildout could make EV charging ports as ubiquitous as gas pumps. At the moment, there aren’t enough reliable charging stations to accommodate a sudden increase in EV usage. About 627,000 plug-in EVs were bought in 2019 and 2020, and demand is expected to increase — especially as carmakers phase out gas-powered cars. “We’re so much better off than we were even five years ago ... but we still have a huge gap,” a Biden administration official told Vox. “This is an essential piece of the shift to EVs and it’s not going to happen on its own.” Transitioning American car drivers to electric vehicles is a crucial piece of the Biden administration’s overall plan to get the United States on a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, as well as its more immediate goal of limiting catastrophic climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent relative to 2005 levels by 2030. The US is the second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, after China, and cars are a big part of that. Transportation emissions account for 29 percent of total US greenhouse gas emissions (more than the electricity sector and industry), and light-duty vehicles like cars account for the vast majority of transportation emissions — close to 60 percent, as of 2018. Getting EV charging stations to be as ubiquitous as gas stations would help change that, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Even more important is increasing the availability and access for home and work charging stations — where experts believe most people will ultimately charge their cars. “Home charging is the most important; that’s where the highest number of charging [stations] will be needed,” said Scott Hardman, a researcher studying hybrids and EVs at the University of California Davis Institute of Transportation Studies. “It’s the cheapest; it’s the most convenient.” In addition to building public charging stations, the Biden administration plans to propose expanding tax credits for private infrastructure for home EV chargers, giving people an incentive to install them. This is key, experts told me; making charging station access equitable — ensuring they are affordable and accessible — is as important as increasing the total number of charging stations. Both are doable but will take serious government investment. But as with the rest of Biden’s agenda, the fate of this proposed network of charging stations could hinge on the fate of bipartisan infrastructure negotiations and whether the president decides to pass his plan with only Democratic votes. A charging station is not the same as a gas station Because gas stations are the most common method of refueling cars in the United States, powering up electric vehicles might call to mind clusters of charging stations next to convenience stores next to a highway or road. But the two modes of powering up are fundamentally different. For one thing, driving into a gas station, filling up, and driving out typically takes just a few minutes. The fastest EV charging stations — like DC Fast — on the other hand, take up to 20 minutes to charge enough to power the vehicle to a 60- to 80-mile range. Some state and city planners and EV experts are working on putting charging stations outside of restaurants, grocery stores, and shops, so that people can go off and eat a meal or shop while their car is refueling. “Most charging, we would hope and expect, is happening while people are doing something else,” said Eric Wood, a research engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Center for Integrated Mobility Sciences. “The idea that charging is happening slowly can be convenient for the driver as well as the grid.” More rapid charging technology is being developed, but the vast majority of available public charging stations currently in the US are the more sluggish Level 2 chargers, which require far more time to get to a full charge. There are just 5,141 DC Fast chargers in the US, with big gaps in parts of the Midwest and Mountain West, according to the Energy Department’s map of charging stations. “If your battery’s down to 20 percent, you’re going to have to stay plugged in for hours and hours,” said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, the former chief global economist at Ford Motor Company, now a senior resident fellow at Third Way. The lack of charging infrastructure can mean headaches for drivers going on road trips, who need to plan their route to hit available charging stations. An October 2020 poll from YouGov found that charging time, hassle of charging, and cost of charging at home were all top reasons buyers who were looking for a new car weren’t considering an electric vehicle. As climate expert and activist Bill McKibben recently found while on a road trip from Vermont to Boston, if you’re in need of some juice and another driver is already using a public charger, you could be in for a nerve-wracking drive home. “The plug was in use once more, so I swallowed hard, did a little math, and drove on, arriving home with red lights flashing on the dashboard and a display indicating that my range was down to two miles,” McKibben recently wrote in the New Yorker. Competition and congestion around EV charging stations has gotten particularly bad in cities like San Francisco, where there’s a growing number of electric car drivers. (The places with the highest density of charging stations per 100,000 people are Vermont, California, Colorado, Hawaii, and Washington, DC.) “In San Francisco, there’s a huge congestion problem, and there are simply not enough plugs for EVs in that metro area,” said Hughes-Cromwick. “There is congestion in areas where EV demand has flourished. If we don’t get going on this, we will have roadblocks, especially for longer trips.” Another complication is that some electric car companies like Tesla — frustrated at the lack of investment in EV charging stations — have built out their own networks of superchargers that are only compatible with their cars. So if a driver of a Chevy Bolt or Nissan Leaf is running low on battery and the only charger around is a Tesla, they’re out of luck. The White House official I spoke to told me that any federal investment in EV charging stations will require universal chargers that can work with the full range of electric vehicles on the market. “It’s been incredibly important for Tesla to have done that buildout, but we’re thinking about this investment as chargers that can support any vehicle,” the official said. “It’s very clear it needs to be accessible for any driver of an EV.” That accessibility — along with the sheer number the White House hopes will be built — ought to, in theory, eliminate lines and congestion around chargers, while also ensuring charging is affordable. One thing it won’t do is solve the problem of charging times, but charging companies are developing faster chargers, and the second part of the White House’s proposal hopes to address that issue as well. Home charging is really important The most common and easiest way to charge an electric car doesn’t necessarily happen alongside a roadway; an at-home charging station “ends up for a lot of Americans being the only place they’d need to charge on a regular basis,” said Wood. Home charging is especially convenient for people who primarily use their electric car for short trips around their town or city; especially if a car has a 200- to 300-mile range, that could get them a couple of days or weeks on a single charge. This is important because Americans do the vast majority of their driving for short trips: Nearly 77 percent of vehicles drove distances of 10 miles or less per trip, according to the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (the most recent available). In other words, it’s far more often that we’re driving home, to work, or to run an errand than going on a long road trip. Home charging may be the most convenient, but home charging is also typically relegated to higher-income people who can actually afford to charge from within their home. For lower-income people who don’t have a garage or a dedicated parking spot with easy access to a charger, the logistics of charging at home become much more complicated. Just as policymakers are figuring out how to make EVs cheaper, experts told me that any expansion of charging stations needs to focus on how to make home charging more equitable and accessible for middle- and lower-income people. One option is getting more charging stations on residential streets, powered by the same electrical lines for street lights. This was piloted in London in 2020, with a number of street lights converted. But this is a relatively small project, and it hasn’t been adopted widely yet in other countries. Another option is increasing the number of charging stations at people’s workplaces, giving them another place to charge while their car is parked for hours. “Everyone parks their car somewhere at night; that’s where we need to get the charging to,” said Hardman. “We have to be careful it’s not just the privileged households that get the lower running costs.” The Biden administration official told Vox that the president’s infrastructure plan is proposing an extended or expanded tax credit to expand private infrastructure like charging stations at home. “There’s an outsize public role for that infrastructure,” the official said. “You have to have a mix of home charging, workplace, and public.” Overall, Biden’s goal is to make EVs more attractive in large part by making charging more convenient. But it will take significant government investment for Biden’s desired 500,000-EV network to become a reality. Getting a bipartisan group of lawmakers — particularly in the Senate, where Democrats need 10 Republican votes to pass legislation under normal rules — to agree to spend nearly $200 billion on EVs won’t be easy, as prolonged infrastructure negotiations have shown. But the US will need to make this change in order to meet its climate commitments, and to decrease its contribution to climate change."
https://www.vox.com/climate/23680273/epa-emissions-rule-electric-vehicles-ev-pollution-climate-regulation-fuel-economy,Vox,left,The EPA's new plan to cut car pollution has an SUV problem,Umair Irfan,4/12/2023,"The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday announced its proposals to slash pollution from just about every vehicle on the road. EPA administrator Michael Regan called the new rules “the strongest ever federal pollution standards for cars and trucks.” But right now, it’s just a proposal, and as past attempts to clean up cars have shown, a lot can change in final regulations, if they get implemented at all. The suite of proposals restricts pollution coming out of tailpipes, not just on cars and pickups, but also on heavy-duty vehicles, including semi trucks, buses, tractors, cherry pickers, and delivery vans. The rules would avert close to 10 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by the middle of the century, equivalent to double the total US emissions in 2022, while cutting dangerous air pollutants like nitrogen oxides in the meantime. They would drop a cinder block on the accelerator away from gasoline and diesel power and toward electric vehicles. In the US, transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gases that are warming the planet, accounting for about 27 percent of total US emissions. Within transportation, light-duty vehicles contribute 57 percent of carbon dioxide pollution, while medium- and heavy-duty vehicles make up 26 percent. So cutting emissions from sedans, SUVs, and school buses is essential to meeting US climate change targets. The Biden administration set a goal to cut overall emissions at least 50 percent relative to 2005 by 2030. “It is well within our grasp,” Regan told reporters at a press briefing. “Make no mistake about it.” Regan acknowledged that the proposal is the start of a process that will take input from the auto industry, labor organizations, and environmental groups. Republican-led states like Texas are already suing the EPA to block its existing climate change regulations for vehicles and will likely challenge the new ones. And Republican judges on federal courts, including the Supreme Court, have shown increasing hostility to environmental regulations. So the final vehicle rules could get watered down, if not stalled entirely. Meanwhile, states like California, New York, Maryland, and Massachusetts — some of the largest car-buying markets in the country — are moving ahead with their own bans on fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Several carmakers, including General Motors, say they are betting on an all-electric future for their fleets. Although the EPA can spur manufacturers to make more electric cars, the bigger challenge is getting people to buy them. EVs are still generally more expensive than their gasoline equivalents, and with interest rates rising, it’s getting more costly to borrow money to buy a car. A poll released Tuesday from the Associated Press and the University of Chicago found that 41 percent of Americans were at least somewhat likely to make their next car electric, but said high price tags remain the main barrier. Current EV owners are also running into growing pains with charging infrastructure as they test the legs of their cars. To further complicate matters, EPA car pollution rules still have loopholes that favor larger, less efficient cars like SUVs and crossovers. The growing size of vehicles is undermining efficiency gains in both electric and fossil fuel-powered motors. Some environmentalists and economists argue that to truly limit climate change, it’s not enough to switch to electric cars; we have to reduce the need for cars altogether. That will require more investment in public transportation and a broader rethinking of how cities are designed. The EPA’s new regulations could accelerate decarbonization efforts, but they must be part of a broader lineup of tactics to reach the net-zero emissions destination. What the EPA’s new car pollution rules actually do The EPA says its vehicle pollution regulations are technology-neutral, and the benchmarks are averaged over an automaker’s fleet of offerings rather than on individual models. The idea is that it gives carmakers the flexibility to try out a suite of approaches and encourages them to target their most popular offerings for emissions cuts rather than making a token clean car that no one buys. The new tailpipe regulations are so stringent, however, that electrification is effectively the only way to meet the targets as they ramp up over time. By 2032, around two-thirds of new passenger cars sold will have to produce zero emissions, which means they’ll largely be battery- and fuel cell-powered electric vehicles. “Our analysis indicates that one pathway the industry could take is to meet the standards with nearly 70 percent electric vehicles by 2032 for light-duty vehicles, and about 40 percent for medium-duty vehicles,” an EPA spokesperson told Vox in an email. “Medium-duty” refers to vehicles that weigh between 8,501 and 14,000 pounds. That would be a huge boost for electric cars, which comprised just 5.8 percent of new car and light truck sales in 2022. While electric vehicles tend to cost more — the average new car last year cost around $48,000, while the average new electric car cost $66,000 — the proposed regulations would save the average car buyer $12,000 over the life of the vehicle, according to the EPA, largely through averted fuel costs and lower maintenance. Across the economy, the regulations would avoid $12 billion in oil imports. The EPA is also leaning on the health benefits of the regulations. By avoiding combustion byproducts like particulates and sulfur oxides, EVs are already having a positive impact on air quality in some parts of the country. Regan said that reducing the harms of this pollution, like heart attacks and asthma attacks, would have between $850 billion and $1.6 trillion in economic benefits over the course of the new rules. But rumbling internal combustion engines aren’t driving off into the sunset just yet. Because the regulations are “technology neutral,” they don’t explicitly outlaw fossil fuels, and the EPA acknowledged that such vehicles will still be on the market. An EPA spokesperson said the agency projects that “advanced gasoline vehicles will continue to be a part of manufacturers’ product plans.” In addition, the regulations affect sales of new vehicles, not existing ones. The average car stays on the road for more than 11 years, so some of the dirtiest vehicles on the road today will still be rolling in 2032 and beyond. The EPA also noted that its proposed emissions rules are not being issued in a vacuum, but are meant to integrate with a host of other climate change policies across the government. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes close to $25 billion for tactics like building out a network of EV chargers and buying zero-emissions school buses, while the Inflation Reduction Act contains around $6 billion in loans and grants to build and deploy more clean vehicles, along with tax credits for buyers, according to the Biden administration. The White House is aiming to nearly triple the current number of public EV chargers to 500,000 by 2030 alongside investments in building a supply chain for batteries and training a workforce for cleaner transportation. The federal government is also using its purchasing power to create a larger market for EVs, including electrifying its largest fleet: postal trucks. Cleaner cars and trucks still have a bumpy road ahead Of course, all this hinges on whether the EPA can implement its proposal as is, and that’s not a guarantee. Some carmakers may push back and argue the targets are unfeasible, while courts could become a roadblock. And the next election could drive everything off course. Car emissions rules at the EPA already took a handbrake turn from Obama, who sought to make them stronger than ever, to Trump, who tried to undo them entirely. Biden’s EPA is making another U-turn, but if he doesn’t hold on to the Oval Office, the next president could throw the regulations in reverse once more. The current economy, with worries about inflation and high interest rates, is also adding potholes for people and businesses driving to buy cleaner vehicles. And the Americans that are buying cars and trucks like ’em big. SUVs and crossovers now account for half of cars sold in the US. The EPA’s Automotive Trends Report last year said that the growing size of vehicles has “offset some of the fleetwide benefits that otherwise would have been achieved from the improvements within each vehicle type.” That includes the environmental benefits of electric cars. Vehicles like SUVs have larger profit margins for carmakers compared to sedans, but the EPA’s regulations also end up giving these bigger, less efficient vehicles more favorable treatment. Crossovers — larger vehicles built on car platforms — are often classified as light-duty trucks rather than cars and thus held to lower fuel efficiency and pollution standards. The distinction can get blurry for the EPA, however. “For instance, one of the best-selling [crossover] models is the Honda CR-V. The two-wheel drive CR-V qualifies as a passenger car, and the all-wheel drive CR-V qualifies as a light truck,” noted the Energy Information Administration. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions from transportation also requires looking beyond cars and trucks, toward creating more viable alternatives like rail, bikes, and even walking in some cases. And roads aren’t the only source of heat-trapping gases: The bigger technical challenge will be decarbonizing shipping and aviation, finding a way to power the largest vehicles without burning fossil fuels. So the EPA’s new vehicle emissions rules have set a new finish line, and some in the industry are already racing toward it. But it will take a steady hand at the wheel to make sure everyone crosses the line. "
https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/15/business/toyota-camry-hybrid-only/index.html,CNN,left,America’s top-selling car will soon come only as a hybrid,Peter Valdes-Dapena,,"The Toyota Camry, the best-selling car in America, is going hybrid-only. The Camry is available in a hybrid version now, but the redesigned 2025 Camry will be offered only as a hybrid car combining a gasoline engine with electric motors. It will join a number of other Toyota models, such as the Sienna minivan, Venza SUV, the Sequoia full-sized SUV and others in being available only as a hybrid. And, of course, there’s still the Prius which, following its recent redesign, was named MotorTrend Car of the Year on Thursday. The decision to go hybrid-only on the Camry points up how accepted the technology has become. Once a novelty found on only a few models – and mostly of interest during gas price spikes – it’s become much more mainstream. So much so that Toyota, a company not known for taking big risks, feels customers are ready to go hybrid-only on this very mainstream sedan. “We’ve been putting electric motors and batteries in vehicles since the first Prius back in 2000, so it’s a space that we know and love,” Mike Tripp, group vice president for Toyota marketing, said in an interview with CNN. Toyota has said that it plans to offer a hybrid version of every vehicle in its line-up. There are only three Toyota models – the GR86 and Supra sports cars, and the 4Runner SUV – without a hybrid option or that have no hybrid version announced. Making the Camry hybrid-only is a big step. The Camry has been the best selling car – that is, one that’s not a truck or SUV – in America for the past 22 years. Along with the Prius, it’s probably the model most associated with the Toyota brand. It has been available in a hybrid version since 2007, but, starting with the redesigned 2025 model, that will no longer be just an option. Making such a popular model hybrid-only might have been a radical step for other automakers, but it’s in keeping with Toyota’s long history with the the technology, said Tyson Jominy, an industry analyst with J.D. Power. “It’s expected of Toyota,” he said. “I don’t think its really unconventional.” The Prius was simultaneously cutting edge and kind of nerdy when it went on sale in the US in 2001. It was one of the first hybrid cars sold here and, after a redesign a few years later, became the first truly popular hybrid car. Toyota soon began adding the technology to other models. In the two decades since the Prius came out, Toyota’s hybrids have proven to be very popular. Even as vehicle prices, in general, have come down in recent months, customers are still paying as much as 2.5% over the manufacturer’s sticker price for Toyota’s hybrid models, according to recent data from Edmunds.com. This is true even as customers are paying deeply discounted prices for all-electric vehicles, despite getting significant tax credits that aren’t available on most hybrids. It’s not that the electric vehicle market isn’t continuing to grow, said Jominy. They’re reaching about 9% of all new vehicle sales now. Dealers are having to discount, though, because there are simply too many EVs available in a similar price range of around $50,000 to $60,000, he said. Hybrids, meanwhile, are also much easier for customers to understand, since the vehicles require no change in an owner’s regular habits, said Jominy. They don’t need to be charged, just filled with gasoline, of which they use less. “What’s crazy for me, demand on Sienna, demand on hybrid Corolla, demand on our new Grand Highlander hybrid, we added hybrid in June of this year to Corolla Cross, so yeah, demand continues to outstrip supply at this point,” said Tripp. Toyota has been much more cautious than other automakers when it comes to all-electric vehicles. Toyota offers only two in the United States, the BZ4X and the Lexus RZ 450e, both SUVs. Toyota executives have long expressed skepticism about consumers’ willingness to embrace fully electric vehicles. They have also said that hybrids are a more effective use of expensive batteries, in terms of actually reducing overall carbon emissions from vehicles. More recently, the company has said it plans to pursue EVs more aggressively while still growing its line-up of hybrid models. The new Camry, like most of Toyota’s other hybrid models, will not be a plug-in hybrid. Its four-cylinder engine, in addition to driving the car, will also charge batteries that will power two electric motors. All together, this system will produce up to 225 horsepower in front-wheel-drive models and 232 horsepower in all-wheel-drive versions. As with other hybrids, the batteries will also be charged as the car brakes. Besides unveiling the new Camry Tuesday night, Toyota also revealed another new hybrid-only SUV model, the Crown Signia. It will be an upscale all-wheel-drive crossover SUV with styling similar to Toyota’s hybrid-only Crown sedan. "
https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/04/business/why-ev-charging-is-still-such-a-pain/index.html,CNN,left,Why EV charging is still such a pain,Peter Valdes-Dapena,11/4/2023,"Powering your car should always be easy, whether you fill it with electrons or gasoline. If it’s an electric car, you should be able to swipe a credit card, plug in the cable and your vehicle will just… charge. And it actually does work that way a decent amount of the time. Unfortunately, not always. There are incompatible charger designs, different charging speeds and acronym overload. (Is that a CCS or NACS? Why can’t I find CHAdeMO when I need it and why is it spelled that way?) There are fast chargers that aren’t always very fast – but it’s not always the charger’s fault. Also, how do I pay for this? Where is a charger, anyway? A lot of problems are being solved and a lot of pointless confusion is getting ironed out as the industry expands and agrees on standards. But other differences just come with the technology and will probably always be this way. Surveys by J.D. Power show that, despite more and more EV chargers being available, EV owners are actually getting less satisfied with public charging. When it comes to consumer satisfaction, EV charging is in some very poor corporate company. “They’re still on the very low end and that’s in comparison with some notoriously low satisfaction industries, like telecoms and cable providers,” said Brent Gruber, managing director of electric vehicle experience at J.D. Power. A lack of chargers remains the biggest complaint, though, said Gruber. There are about 144,000 public EV chargers in the United States, according to the Department of Energy. About 42,000 of those are in California. States like Mississippi and Montana — admittedly far less populous but people still have to drive there — have only a few hundred. Public EV charging is especially complicated. First of all, there are currently different charger types. Do you have a Tesla or something else? Most major automakers have said they will switch to Tesla’s NACS, or North American Charging System format in a few years but that hasn’t happened yet. Fortunately, most of those non-Tesla automakers all have a type of charging port called the Combined Charging System or CCS. Charging ports: What all the letters mean With CCS, you can feel confident that if you find a charger that’s not a Tesla charger, you should be able to use it. Well, unless you have a Nissan Leaf, which has a ChaDeMo (or Charge de Move) port for fast charging. In that case, you may have a harder time finding a place to plug in. One of the nice things about having an EV is that it’s possible to charge at home if you can install a home charger. With a home charger, it’s like having a gas pump in your garage. Just plug in and wake up in the morning to a “full tank” that costs much less per mile than what you pay for gasoline. Away from home, charging your EV costs more than charging at home, sometimes twice as much. (Someone has to pay to maintain that charger in addition to the electricity itself.) There’s also a lot more to think about. The history long of electric cars First, how fast is that charger? There are mostly two types of public charger, Level 2 and Level 3. (Level 1 is basically just plugging into a regular outlet.) Level 2, relatively slow, is convenient for those times when you’re out at a movie or a restaurant, say, and you want to just pick up some electricity while you’re parked. The math and myth of fast charging If you’re on a long trip and want to juice up fast so you can back on the highway, that’s what Level 3 chargers are for. But, with these, there are a few things you have to keep in mind. How fast is fast? With a really fast charger, some cars can go from a 10% state of charge to 80% in just 15 minutes or so, adding another 100 miles every few minutes. (Charging usually slows down past 80% to reduce harm to the batteries.) But a lot of fast chargers are much slower. Fifty kilowatt fast chargers are common but take much longer than 150 or 250 kw chargers. The car has its own limitations, too, and not every car can charge as fast as every charger. Your electric car and the charger communicate to sort this out. When you first plug in an electric car, a lot of information passes back-and-forth between the vehicle and the charger before any electricity starts moving, said Nathan Wang, project manager at UL Solutions Advanced Electric Vehicles Charging Lab. For one thing, the vehicle has to let the charger know how fast it can safely charge and the charger needs to respect that speed limit. The popular Chevrolet Bolt EV, for instance, can only charge at up to 55 kilowatts. You can choose to plug into a faster charger, but you won’t get done any sooner. The charger just slows down to match the car’s needs. Beyond that, even if your electric vehicle can charge at up to 250 kilowatts and so can the charger, you may get less speed than that. It could be because, say, you’re at a location with six fast chargers and every one has a car plugged in. The chargers may reduce output to all the vehicles rather than overload the system, said Wang. Of course, there could also just be random technical issues. With so much energy moving around, if anything seems like it might be wrong, the system could just put everything on hold. “Safety is paramount,” said Rick Wilmer, chief operating officer of EV charging provider ChargePoint. “Obviously, you don’t want to hurt anybody or burn a car so anything that looks like it can pose a risk of any sort … we will automatically shut everything down, of course.” Still, ChargePoint’s chargers operate the great majority of the time, Wilmer said. What’s coming next Then there are the different EV charging networks. When you want some gas, it doesn’t make too much difference where you get it from. Whether it’s Shell, BP, Exxon or whichever, they pretty much all work the same way. With EV chargers, using a different charging network can mean you have to download a new smartphone app and open an account with some other service before you can charge. This is something the charging industry groups have been working to clear up, though. One thing J.D. Power’s surveys indicate is that drivers who plan ahead for charging seem to happier than those who don’t, said Gruber. These days, a variety of apps and vehicles’ own navigation systems make it fairly easy to plan routes with charging stops. You can see what type of chargers are where and whether they’re available right now. Charging companies are working on being able to provide even more detailed information such as how long until a car that’s currently using a charger will be finished, said Mark Hawkinson, head of the technical solutions group at ABM, a company that sets up charging stations. And as complicated as charging an EV can be, every little bit of extra information helps. "
https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/23/cars/solid-state-battery-tech-promises-to-radically-change-evs/index.html,CNN,left,Solid state batteries promise to radically change EVs. But they may not be the only answer,Peter Valdes-Dapena,11/23/2023,"Electric cars are supposed to be the future, but they still have issues that are keeping away many car buyers. The range is too short. The batteries are too heavy and expensive. They take too long to charge. But a number of companies say they have the technology to solve many — maybe even all — of these problems. Toyota, in particular, has said it might be on the cusp of such a breakthrough. Other automakers are also working with various battery companies on versions of this new technology. The would-be breakthrough is called a “solid state battery,” and the only problem is that — much like other vaunted Earth-changing technologies — for a few years now, it’s always been just a couple of years away. Car companies including Stellantis, Hyundai and Volkswagen have also teamed up with firms working on solid state batteries. The technology holds the promise of batteries that are smaller and lighter while providing more power. They could be safer with less chance of catching fire in a crash, too. But solid state technology has its own challenges, and it’s not the only way automakers could achieve lighter, cheaper and faster charging electric vehicles. Battery basics The main difference between a solid state battery and the lithium-ion batteries currently used in electric cars is a component known as the electrolyte. In a lithium-ion battery, the electrolyte is a gooey liquid. In a solid state battery, the electrolyte is, well, a solid. That solid electrolyte is one reason that solid state batteries might be safer than lithium-ion batteries. If a liquid electrolyte battery is broken or punctured, the two sides of the electrolyte can ooze together, which can lead to an uncontrolled energy flow, followed by a fire. Generally speaking, solids are also denser than liquids meaning the electrolyte takes up less space and battery cells can be smaller. But some companies are working on other strategies, as well, that can make batteries still smaller and lighter and, also, faster charging. The main challenge for all of these companies, and the automakers that have invested in them, is how to produce these hi-tech batteries economically in the sort of numbers needed to build affordable electric cars. Meanwhile, there are competing battery technologies for which manufacturing techniques are well established. It’s a wide-open field right now with a number of start-up companies each working with different chemical combinations and even slightly different physical structures for their batteries. There’s still no clearly superior technology, said William Kephart, a battery researcher at the consulting firm P3 Group Fast charging times, a key consumer demand, is one challenge for solid-state batteries. Generally, it takes the lithium ions in the batteries used currently more time to move through a rigid material than a liquid, Kephart said. That tends to make it take longer to receive energy, which slows charging times, and makes it slower to release energy — which drags on a vehicle’s acceleration. Solid-state battery company Quantumscape claims that its solid-state batteries — which use some liquid, but not for the electrolyte — have been tested and can charge even faster than typical lithium ion batteries. Solid-state batteries will tend to be more expensive because they contain more lithium, which is expensive, said Kephart. Lithium prices will come down as more sources are found and accessed, he said, but, compared to other batteries, solid-state batteries will tend to cost more. A company called Factorial, which counts Stellantis and Mercedes as investors, claims its solid-state battery technology uses less lithium than traditional batteries, which could potentially reduce costs, especially as production ramps up. “We think the costing actually will be competitive because lithium, just from the raw material perspective, it’s not a scarce material,” said Factorial chief executive Siyu Huang. Quantumscape also say its battery design eliminates graphite, reducing expense and, the company claims, greatly reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing. Other options At the same time, though, some other battery companies are working to improve traditional liquid-electrolyte batteries, improvements that could make that existing technology better. Just changing the one piece of the battery by adding silicone could yield big improvements in performance at relatively low cost. That’s what’s proposed by a company called OneD Battery Sciences, in which GM has invested. OneD’s technology allows production processes to stay roughly the same while promising big improvements in performance, according to the company. That means less trouble and expense for battery manufacturers and automakers. Other companies are working on semi-solid state batteries that combine parts of each type of battery, providing some of the benefits of solid state without completely ditching the standard fluid-based design. Ultimately, there probably will never be one battery technology used in all EVs, GM spokesperson Phil Lienert said. The type of batteries will be matched to the vehicle and the specific market where it’s sold. It’s similar to how automakers use different engines in various models and in different markets. GM’s Ultium electric vehicle design, which underlies all of GM’s EV models, was specifically engineered to enable the use of all different sorts of batteries. “When you have a customer lineup as big and diverse as ours, you need to have multiple solutions that can coexist” within the same basic engineering, he said.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/business/electric-cars-have-more-problems-but-not-because-theyre-electric/index.html,CNN,left,"Electric cars are having more problems, but not because they're electric",Peter Valdes-Dapena,12/4/2023,"Electric vehicles have 79% more problems than other vehicles, according to Consumer Reports’ latest annual auto reliability survey. But the problem isn’t really because they’re electric, said Jake Fisher, director of the group’s auto testing center. The problems arise because electric cars are mostly new models, and recently-introduced car models generally tend to have more issues, regardless of what propels them. Car companies haven’t had years to work out all the kinks as they have the models they’ve been producing for years. Besides that, electric vehicles tend to be higher priced models with more sophisticated technology features, from additional safety sensors to more gadgets and doo-dads. All those fancy features present more opportunities for stuff to go wrong. “If you look at EVs, they tend to be very loaded with new technology, all the latest gizmos and screens,” said Fisher. EV owners report problems with batteries and charging, as well, but that’s still largely the result of the newness of these vehicles, too, said Fisher. It’s not that the technology is inherently problematic. “If all the manufacturers had been building electric cars for 100 years, and then suddenly one of them decided to build an internal combustion engine with a transmission, it’d be riddled with problems,” said Fisher. Consumer Reports surveys its subscribers annually about their experiences with their 330,000 individual vehicles. The final results are calculated based on the combined data from the three most recent years. For models that are very new, past reliability data for the manufacturer, overall, can be used to supplement data for the new model. Electric pickup trucks, in particular, tended to fare the worst in Consumer Reports’ reliability survey. That’s because they exist at the intersection of two particularly unreliable vehicle types, EVs and pickups. Not all electric vehicles are so unreliable, though, according to Consumer Reports’ survey data. The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, as well as the Ford Mustang Mach-E, for instance, have average expected reliability. The Nissan Ariya and Hyundai Ioniq 6 have better-than-average expected reliability. The least reliable models, on average, were plug-in hybrids, according to the survey. The reason for that, according to Consumer Reports, is that, with gas engines, electric motors and charging systems, they’re vulnerable to all the things that can go wrong in either a gas or electric vehicle. Hybrids that don’t plug in, on the other hand, were the most reliable vehicles of all, Consumer Reports said. That’s largely thanks to the companies that make them “One of the reasons why hybrids are very reliable is they tend to come from reliable automakers such as Toyota, for sure, and Honda, Hyundai, Kia,” said Fisher.

https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/06/health/electric-vehicles-save-nearly-90-000-lives/index.html,CNN,left,"Move to electric vehicles could save nearly 90,000 lives in US by 2050, study says",Jen Christensen,6/7/2023,"If gas guzzlers disappeared from US car lots by 2035 and were replaced by zero-emissions vehicles – essentially, electric cars, trucks and SUVs – the nation would see 89,300 fewer premature deaths by 2050, according to a new report from the American Lung Association. But the country would also have to move more toward clean noncombustion electricity – like wind, solar, hydro, geothermal and nuclear – to see the full health benefit. The report, published Wednesday, says that people in the US would have 2.2 million fewer asthma attacks and 10.7 million fewer lost workdays, and the country would net $978 billion in public health benefits with the move to cleaner vehicles and a cleaner power supply. “There are very clear benefits of zero-emission technologies,” said report author William Barrett, national senior director for clean air advocacy for the American Lung Association. The “Driving to Clean Air: Health Benefits of Zero-Emission Cars and Electricity” report uses an analysis of data from the association’s March 2022 report “Zeroing in on Healthy Air.” Transportation is the leading source of air pollution in the US and the largest creator of carbon pollution that drives the climate crisis, the US Environmental Protection Agency has found. And exposure to any kind of pollution hurts our health: Studies show that it significantly raises the risk of premature death or chronic conditions like asthma, heart problems and even depression and Alzheimer’s. About 120 million people in the US live in areas with unhealthy air, according to an American Lung Association report published this year. Low-income communities and communities of color, regardless of income, are disproportionately affected by this health threat. These communities often live closer to major sources of air pollution like major highways and power plants, studies show. “This transition to zero-emission technologies is critical as a whole but especially critical in making sure that we’re targeting policies and investments and incentive programs so that all communities can take advantage of these health benefits and more healthier transportation choices,” Barrett said. The switch to zero-emission vehicles would mean a massive change for the US. Although the number of people who drive them is growing, just 4.6% of cars sold in the US in 2021 were electric, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The switch would require an investment up-front, says Dr. Jason West, who studies pollution research and its impact on public health, but the benefits may well exceed the costs of those actions in the first place. “There are huge health benefits to be gained by switching broadly to electric vehicles,” said West, a professor in the Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina, who was not involved with the new report. “The other part of the report says that this positive health result comes when it is coupled with noncombustion electricity generation. So that’s an important part, too. It’s not just switching to electric vehicles but providing the extra electricity needed for those electric vehicles. So that would be renewables, wind and solar or possibly nuclear.” The auto industry and the federal government are taking big steps to speed the change to zero-emission vehicles. The Biden administration has been making a push to reduce pollution on two fronts through stricter vehicle emissions standards and more aggressive limits on pollution from the energy sector. In 2021, the EPA restored Obama-era auto-pollution rules. In April, the agency proposed a rule that would create even stricter emissions standards for all cars and light trucks. If the rule is finalized, it will probably make at least two-thirds of new cars and trucks on the road zero-emission by 2032, the American Lung Association says. The EPA has also proposed rules that would set more aggressive limits on particle pollution, greenhouse gases and ozone-forming emissions. The draft of the rule on particle pollution alone would tighten the current limit – which has been on the books since 2012 – by 25%. By the administration’s estimate, that could prevent at least 4,200 premature deaths annually. Congress has also worked to limit pollution. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act created incentives for Americans to buy zero-emission vehicles, extending a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of a new electric vehicle until August 2032. It’s also the first time the tax credit could be applied to purchase a used electric vehicle. The 2022 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act should also accelerate the creation of networks that that could keep fuel electric cars on the road. The act provides money to upgrade the nation’s power grid and $7.5 billion to build out a nationwide charging network. States have taken additional steps to reduce traffic-related pollution. Seven, including California, have adopted a policy that says all sales of new passenger vehicles would have to be zero-emission by 2035, and more states are seriously looking at adopting it, Barrett said. More than 15 states have instituted additional state-level vehicle standards. More automakers are also moving to make cleaner vehicles. There is a wider range of options than ever, and battery capacity and range have vastly improved – and are expected to get even better in the near future. Most major carmakers plan to roll out dozens of new models over the next decade and are investing billions in building plants for battery production and other electric vehicle innovations. “The return on investment in clean air policies is well-known, and it really speaks to the efficacy of policies that demand changes to clean the air,” Barrett said. “They create improved health, reduce climate pollution and create jobs in new sectors and have many, many benefits.” "
https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/business/americans-bought-1-million-electric-this-year/index.html,CNN,left,Americans bought more than a million electric vehicles this year,Peter Valdes-Dapena,12/6/2023,"Americans purchased one million fully electric vehicles in 2023, the first time that many EVs have ever been sold in this country in a single year. More than 960,000 purely electric vehicles had been sold through October, according to a report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. With expected sales since then, the million mark would have been passed last month. The estimate was confirmed by Cox Automotive, which closely tracks US auto sales. These figures include only purely electric vehicles, and do not include plug-hybrids, which are sometimes included in these sorts of analyses. The increase has been driven, in large part, by the increased variety of EV models available. By the second half of 2023, there were 95 EV models available in the US, a 40% increase over just one year. Also, in the US, the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, has helped boost sales. Electric vehicles accounted for about 8% of all new vehicles sales in the US during the first half of 2023, according to the Bloomberg NEF report. That’s still far lower than in China, where EVs accounted for 19% of all vehicle sales. Worldwide, EVs made up 15% of new passenger vehicle sales. In 2022, China accounted for 54% of all EV sales in the world in the first half of 2023, while Europe accounted for 26%. The US, the world’s third-largest EV market, accounted for only 12%. North America, which includes the US, still produces a higher volume of carbon emissions from road transportation than any other major global region, according to Bloomberg NEF. Globally, carbon emissions from vehicles continue to rise despite increasing EV sales. It will take until later in this decade for electric vehicles to meaningfully impact global carbon emissions, according to the Bloomberg NEF report. “Even outside of Tesla, you’ve seen progress for Rivian and you’ve seen progress for Hyundai, Kia,” Corey Cantor, senior associate for electric vehicles at BNEF said. “You’ve seen Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and BMW having pretty solid years in the US market.” Ford reported record EV sales in November, including record sales for the F-150 Lightning electric truck, a model for which it had earlier scaled back production. “If you look at the market as a whole, we’re going end up above 50% growth year on year,” said Cantor. “And that’s pretty healthy, you know, given that you’re coming from a fairly high base last year.” There have been reports that EV demand had diminished this year, but any slow-down was slight, state Cantor. Ultimately, US EV sales came in at just a few hundred thousand less than had been projected, Cantor said. One reason for the slightly lower sales than might have been expected has to do with the shift from eager early adopter customers to more cautious ordinary car buyers, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. Auto dealers also need to do a better job of educating their customers about the benefits and value of electric vehicles, she said. "
https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/20/cars/electric-cars-sales-gas-cars-dg/index.html,CNN,left,"Electric cars are breaking sales records, but here's why they're not replacing gas cars anytime soon",Christopher Hickey,8/20/2023,"More shoppers are choosing electric vehicles so far this year than ever, according to vehicle sales data from Cox Automotive. While EV sales have been growing healthily for the past couple of years, that trend has accelerated this year. US consumers bought nearly 300,000 new battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) in the second quarter – a new record, according to Cox. Not only is that more than 48% higher than last year, it’s more EVs than were sold in all of 2019. That’s not even counting sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which can run on gas or electricity and a battery that can be recharged with either a charging cable or a generator powered by the engine. Cox Automotive now predicts sales of fully electric vehicles in the US will break the 1 million vehicle barrier in 2023 for the first time ever. More than 557,000 BEVs have already been sold so far this year through the end of the second quarter. Experts say EV sales are being propelled by a number of compounding factors, such as price cuts, a wider variety of available vehicles and more government and manufacturing investments. “It’s just this perfect storm of all these things coming together,” said Stephanie Valdez-Streaty, the director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. The Inflation Reduction Act is also driving sales growth, Valdez-Streaty told CNN. Through the IRA, the federal government began offering tax credits of up to $7,500 on EVs at the beginning of the year, partially based on where the cars and their electrical components were sourced and assembled. Only 18 EV models out of the 97 on the market currently qualify for this tax credit, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a nonprofit trade association. This year’s top-selling EVs – the Tesla Model 3, Tesla Model Y, Chevrolet Bolt, Rivian R1T and Volkswagen ID.4 – qualify for at least some of the IRA tax credit, Valdez-Streaty said. The electric vehicle market is entering into a transition period, she said. More than half of consumers were considering buying a new or used BEV within the next year, according to a Cox Automotive survey released in June. Just 38% of consumers said the same in 2021. “We’ve had early adopters, and now it’s like, how do we start to increase sales? How do we convert those considerers into buyers?” Valdez-Streaty said. The US Energy Information Administration’s sales projections forecast that translating buyer interest into an EV-majority market will take several decades. Assuming that the current laws and regulations remain unchanged, the annual percentage of newly purchased BEVs and PHEVs flattens at roughly 17-19% from 2035 through at least 2050, according to EIA projections. And while consumer interest in EVs is sensitive to the price of gasoline, the agency predicts an EV market share of less than 30% under even a scenario with oil prices as high as $190 per barrel in 2022 dollars. Price is the biggest barrier for consumers, Valdez-Streaty said. Despite sharp price cuts by Tesla and Ford this year, going electric still means paying a premium over the average gas-powered model. The average electric vehicle price in July was $53,469, according to Kelley Blue Book, versus an average price of $48,334 across all vehicles. In Cox’s consumer survey, the second biggest concern for EV considerers after price was a lack of access to charging stations. Battery ranges have improved in recent years – the number of electric models with a range of at least 300 miles increased from 13 in 2021 to 51 in 2023, according to the US Department of Energy. But the number of charging stations still lags behind what is needed to support a wider-scale adoption of electric vehicles. At the end of Q1 2023, there were roughly 134,000 charging stations and 3.34 million EVs on the road across the country, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation’s most recent Electric Vehicle Quarterly Report. To meet a charger-to-car ratio of 7:1 — which the California Energy Commission concluded would be needed to support the state’s goal of 5 million EVs on the road by 2030 — the entire country would have to set up two and a half times the current number of available chargers, the AAI report said. Geographic disparities are also pervasive, the report said. Nearly 30% of all the country’s public charging infrastructure is in California. The market share of new EVs is also much higher in California, according to AAI state sales data. The Golden State – along with the District of Columbia – is the only market where electric vehicles made up more than a fifth of all light-duty vehicle sales in March, the most recent month available. Making sure the charging infrastructure is in place and operational will be important to support EV sales growth going forward, Valdez-Streaty said. So will state and national incentives. Last year, the California Air Resources Board voted to ban sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035. At least 17 other states have agreed to follow California’s lead. “It’ll be interesting to see over the next few years how sales start to increase with those states following the CARB regulations,” Valdez-Streaty said. "
https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/27/business/affordable-electric-vehicles/index.html,CNN,left,Electric cars aren't just for the wealthy anymore,Peter Valdes-Dapena,7/27/2023,"Thanks to a combination of new models, more production and new tax laws, electric vehicles are no longer just for the wealthy. While the average sale price of a new vehicle – gasoline or electric – hovers around $48,000, automakers like General Motors, Ford, Hyundai, Kia and Volkswagen have all introduced a variety of electric vehicles that come in significantly below that figure. Plus, there are ways for car shoppers to take advantage of tax credits on electric vehicles without having to worry about arcane rules around battery sourcing and limits on the buyer’s personal income. All of which means that you can now find a relatively cheap EV, whether you’re planning to lease or buy. Tax credits and leased cars Due to a quirk in America’s tax laws, if the vehicle is being leased, rather than purchased, the full $7,500 tax credit can be used for most new electric vehicles. The vehicle doesn’t have to be built in the US, nor do the batteries. The difference is the tax credit goes to the leasing company – which is, really, the “purchaser” of the vehicle – not to the person who has the vehicle in their driveway. Because it’s been purchased by a company, any car you lease is a “commercial vehicle” and gets the benefit of more lax tax rules for commercial vehicle purchases, explained Mark Luxcombe, principal analyst with the tax and accounting firm Wolters Kluwer. The credit can then be passed along in the form of lower lease payments, so the consumer still gets the benefit. “There’s still some restrictions on the the cost of the vehicle and that sort of thing, but you don’t have the income restrictions, you don’t have some of the battery and sourcing restrictions,” Luxcombe said. More models being offered has led to a glut of available electric vehicles, according to an analysis by Cox Automotive. Currently the “days supply” of electric vehicles – a measure of the number units on dealer lots relative to how quickly they sell – is now twice that of new vehicles overall. That’s not because electric vehicles are selling poorly, said Brian Moody, executive editor at Autotrader, but because carmakers are introducing more new models while production of vehicles of all sorts is increasing. This is still a relatively new phenomenon, said Moody, but already there are some purchase incentives and even pricing adjustments, like Ford dropping the price of the F-150 Lightning. Bargaining power could be shifting to the buyer’s side. “There’s a good chance that, if you really want an electric car, depending on the model, [the price] may not just be set in stone the way it was, say, two years ago,” said Moody. The biggest bargain among electric vehicles currently, whether you lease or buy, happens to be one that’s going away soon. The Chevrolet Bolt EV and the very similar Bolt EUV, a slightly taller, more SUV-ish version, will go out of production by the end of 2023 after what is expected to be their best sales year ever. Because the Bolt is made in America, and so are its batteries, buyers can get a $7,500 credit regardless of whether they buy or lease. With a starting price of just $26,500 before the credit, the Bolt EV is relatively cheap for any sort of new vehicle, electric or not. For a total price that could come in under $20,000, you get an EV that’s practical and, belying its techno-dorky appearance, even kind of fun to drive. The only real downside to the Bolt compared to its competitors is a rather slow maximum charging speed. While some other electric vehicles can charge from 10% to 80% in just 20 minutes or so at a fast charger, the Bolt takes much longer. And at least, while you’re waiting, you can think about all the money you saved. The current version of the Bolt is going out of production later this year, but GM has already announced that a new version, with new battery technology – and, presumably, faster charging – will be available before too long. If you want fast charging, Hyundai and Kia have solid options These Korean brands – both are part of the Hyundai Motor Group – have quietly turned into electric vehicle powerhouses over the past few years. Hyundai won the Car and Driver’s EV of the Year Award two years in a row with sequentially numbered models, the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6. Although they don’t look it, both the blocky Ioniq 5 and the curvy Ionig 6 share a lot of their engineering with the wedge-shaped Kia EV6. All have sticker prices around $43,000 and they also have electrical systems enabling among the fastest charging speeds available. Also, they have long driving ranges. The Kia EV6 can go up to 310 miles on a full battery and the Hyundai Ioniq 6 as far as 361 miles. “Usually, you’re in the premium brand sphere to get that kind of range,” said Tony Quiroga, editor-in-chief of Car and Driver. For almost $10,000 less, in terms of sticker price, Hyundai offers the soon-to-be redesigned Kona Electric. It’s not as sharp-looking as its newer relations and doesn’t charge as fast – though still faster than the Bolt – but it’s practical, drives nicely and, at $34,000 before that tax credit, it’s a bargain. That low price, with the tax credit, can translate to a monthly lease in the $400 range or less if you trade in a vehicle or make a down payment, a “capitalized cost reduction” or “cap cost reduction,” in leasing lingo, according to Edmunds.com’s lease calculator. The Volkswagen ID.4 is another strong contender at a relatively low price. Some critics don’t like some of its fussy controls, but it’s attractive and pleasant to drive. Quiroga prefers the all-wheel-drive version, which has more power thanks to its two electric motors. With a sticker price starting around $40,000, it’s eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit whether leased or purchased. The only challenge for these vehicles is that, for now, the Chevrolet Bolt still exists, said Quiroga. If you don’t mind waiting a while to charge but you’re ready to go electric, it’s just a hard deal to beat. "
https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/politics/car-pollution-standards-electric-vehicles-biden-climate/index.html,CNN,left,EPA proposes new tailpipe rules that could push EVs to make up two-thirds of new car sales in US by 2032,Ella Nilsen,4/12/2023,"The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed ambitious new car pollution rules that could require electric vehicles to account for up to two-thirds of new cars sold in the US by 2032, in what would be one of the Biden administration’s most aggressive climate-change policies yet. The tailpipe standards would also have the effect of cutting planet-warming pollution from cars in half. Transportation accounts for nearly 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the US, according to the EPA. EPA Administrator Michael Regan called the regulations “the strongest-ever federal pollution standards for cars and trucks.” Regan touted the proposed rules on “CNN News Central” on Wednesday, claiming they would bring down costs for consumers and slash planet-warming pollution. “This is a future for everyone, and we’re starting to see all of the auto industry move in this direction,” Regan told CNN’s Sara Sidner, saying strong auto emissions rules have been part of President Joe Biden’s “vision from day one.” EPA officials said that they are considering several different emissions proposals, which could result in anywhere from a 64% to 69% electric vehicle adoption rate by early next decade. If approved, the emissions standards would start model year 2027 vehicles. The agency anticipates the new rules would mean EVs could also make up nearly half of all new medium-duty vehicles, like delivery trucks, by model year 2032. Officials are also proposing stronger standards for heavy-duty vehicles, including dump trucks, public utility trucks, and transit and school buses. One expert told CNN the Biden administration’s proposal is a pivotal moment for the US auto industry and consumers. “It’s a pretty big deal,” said Thomas Boylan, a former Environmental Protection Agency official and the regulatory director for the EV trade group Zero Emission Transportation Association. “This is really going to set the tone for the rest of the decade and into the 2030s in terms of what this administration is looking for the auto industry to do when it comes to decarbonizing and ultimately electrifying.” Regan and White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi hailed the proposed regulations as a major climate win that would also save American consumers money in the coming years. Zaidi said that in the Biden administration’s first few years, the number of EVs on US roads had already tripled, while the number of public charging stations had doubled. And Zaidi vowed more to come, with funding from Biden’s infrastructure law for a network of EV charging stations combined with consumer tax credits. “Whether you measure today’s announcements by the dollars saved, the gallons reduced, or the pollution that will no longer be pumped into the air, this is a win for the American people,” Zaidi said. Yet even as the administration is writing aggressive regulations to push the market toward EVs, a Gallup poll released Wednesday suggests that Americans are not yet sold on the idea. Gallup polled more than 1,000 adults in the US last month and found that 41% said they would not buy an electric vehicle. Not only are EVs still more expensive than gas-powered cars, but consumers also haven’t yet grasped the climate benefits of transitioning to zero-emissions vehicles, the poll found. Six in 10 respondents said they believe EVs help the environment “only a little” or “not at all,” Gallup reported. Transportation is the biggest source of planet-warming pollution in the US, and light duty vehicles – the average cars Americans drive – account for 58% of those emissions. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported last year that aggressive, pollution-slashing changes in the global transportation sector – including the transition to EVs – could reduce the sector’s emissions by more than 80%. Speaking on CNN, Regan also emphasized that switching to an EV would save consumers money in the long run. “Folks who purchase electric vehicles will see a cost savings over the lifespan of the vehicle, because they’re not having to buy gas, having to pay for maintenance,” Regan said. “So this is a huge opportunity for everyone in this country.” Other countries, including the EU and China, are moving faster toward adopting EVs. In the US, California has already proposed that zero-emissions vehicles make up 70% of new car sales by 2030, and 17 other states plan to follow California’s lead. That means much of the US car industry will already be transitioning ahead of the proposed federal rules. “I believe it’s pretty doable,” Margo Oge, chair of the International Council on Clean Transportation and a former Obama EPA official, said of the aggressive transition to EVs. “The industry is there. Europe is ahead of the US, China is ahead of Europe – and these companies are global companies.” New federal tax credits are coming next week that aim to help American consumers save up to $7,500 on an EV. But they have incredibly complex requirements for the auto industry – including that the cars’ batteries and components come from the US or countries it has a free-trade agreement with. Still, Boylan said the regulations are designed to gradually work over the next decade, by which time consumers should have far more electric vehicle options to choose from. “You’ve got the tax credits as the carrot,” Boylan said. The proposed tailpipe regulation “provides the stick to backstop these incentives and push the industry forward.” Regan told CNN the rules would be phased in gradually, giving auto makers and consumers years before they fully go into effect. During that time, the administration is focused on installing more EV charging stations and expanding access to $7,500 federal EV tax credits. “What we’re looking at is a ramp-up period,” Regan said on CNN. “We’re going to see a massive buildup over the next couple years, and we’re starting to see those electric vehicle sales numbers grow already.” The EPA will take public comment on the proposal before finalizing the rules in the coming months.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/business/electric-vehicle-save-money/index.html,CNN,left,An electric car finally makes financial sense,Peter Valdes-Dapena,6/8/2022,"Gas prices that keep going up by the day have got a lot of people thinking about buying an electric vehicle. There is no question that electric vehicles cost much, much less to fuel than gasoline-powered models, especially with gas prices at around almost $5 a gallon on average, according to AAA. It almost never makes sense to buy a new car just to save money on fuel, however. New cars tend to cost more money than you would save on fuel, but if you’re already in the market for a new car, an electric vehicles could be an excellent option. “Most of our analysis has shown that, from a financial perspective, if you’re buying a new vehicle, it makes a lot of sense for most people to at least strongly consider an electric vehicle if it fits their lifestyle,” said Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst for Consumer Reports. For instance, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates it will cost around $2,900 a year for the average American to fuel a 2022 BMW 430i sedan. (The base model 4-series sedan gets 28 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving, and it uses Premium fuel, which the EPA calculates at a national average of about $5.39 a gallon.) The estimated cost to fuel a 2022 BMW i4 eDrive40, which is basically the same car but powered entirely by electricity, is about $600 for a year. That’s one fifth the cost. A difference that large assumes gas prices stay as high as they currently are, which we can’t really know. (On other hand, we can’t really assume they won’t either.) These costs also assume a certain rate for electricity, and electricity costs – while generally much lower per mile than gasoline – vary a lot from place to place, and even by time of day. Many electric cars, once they’ve been plugged in, can be set to begin charging only when electricity rates are at their lowest, a bit like if you only fueled up your gasoline car when prices at the pump were at their lowest. Gas prices and electricity prices both fluctuate, of course, and vary from place to place, but, generally speaking, electric cars are vastly cheaper than gas cars on a cents-per-mile basis. That’s partly due to the fact that electric motors are much more efficient than gasoline engines. More than 85% of the energy that goes through an electric motor is converted into movement. For a a gasoline engine, that figure is around 40%. So even if the electricity and fuel costs were completely equal, an electric car should, in theory, be cheaper to own than a gasoline car. But, of course, you don’t generally get a huge discount on fuel costs for nothing. The i4 costs about $10,000 more than the base model BMW 4-series with a gas engine, but the electric BMW i4 is also eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit, reducing the ultimate price difference to just $2,500. And that’s not considering state tax rebates or other incentives electric cars may be eligible for. In some states, with federal and state incentives combined, the electric car could even cost less than the gas-powered one, based on sticker price. Not all electric cars are eligible for those federal tax credits, though. Cars from Tesla and General Motors, for instance, are no longer eligible. So even with the federal tax incentive alone, going with the electric BMW over the gasoline BMW, you would make up the basic purchase price difference in a little over a year. Electric cars do tend to cost more than gasoline cars mostly because of high battery costs. That’s one reason there are so many more electric vehicle options among luxury brands. There are also mainstream brand options such as the Kia EV6 and Hyundai Ioniq 5. The Chevrolet Bolt EV is also back on the market now, following a massive battery recall, and with a new lower price. Toyota also recently came out with its own EV, the BZ4X, that’s similar to Subaru’s new EV SUV, the Solterra. Even these mainstream models tend to cost somewhat more, in terms of sticker price, than their gas-powered siblings. Keep in mind that auto dealers also aren’t required to charge the sticker price. In the past, customers were usually able to negotiate prices down but, with cars in short supply due to parts shortages, dealers are often charging more. That’s especially true for electric vehicles, said Ivan Drury, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com. It might not be enough to entirely wipe out fuel savings but the upcharges can eat into the potential savings. Dealers are charging, on average, $2,700 over the sticker price for Hyundai’s electric Ioniq5 and $3,100 more for the electric Kia EV6, for example. Mustang Mach-E electric SUVs are going for almost $1,900 over MSRP, according to data from Edmunds.com. While lots of cars these days are going for over sticker price, electric cars are being marked up, on average, twice as much as gas-powered ones, according to Edmunds.com. While internal combustion-powered cars are selling for, on average, 1.4% above MSRP, electric vehicles are getting marked up an average of 3.4% Insurance rates are similar between electric and gas-powered cars, according to various experts. Electric can cars cost more to insure only to the extent that they’re generally more expensive cars to begin with. Electric cars can cost less to maintain, though, according to Consumer Reports, which based its finding on extrapolations from owner survey data. Since they have far fewer moving parts that wear and require lubrication, electric cars can cost about half as much to maintain as internal combustion-powered cars, Harto said. Another thing to keep in mind is that It rarely makes financial sense to purchase an electric car if you aren’t able to charge at home, or someplace else, at standard electricity rates. Public chargers are fine for occasional use when you aren’t able to charge at home, such as on long road trips. Still, even at current high gas prices, charging at a public charger can cost much less than buying gasoline, said Aaron Bragman, Detroit bureau chief for the website Cars.com. It usually costs about $20 to $30 to recharge the battery compared to the more than $60 it often costs to fill up with gasoline. Many carmakers offer some amount of free public charging for a couple of years after buying one of their electric cars, though. Also, some public charging providers, like Electrify America, offer discount plans for regular users that can cut the cost more, said Bragman. The question of eventual resale value remains unsettled. While Teslas retain their value very well, other electric cars with comparable battery range haven’t been on the market long enough to know if they’ll perform similarly in the used car market, various experts said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/14/opinion/electric-vehicles-toyota-hybrids.html,The New York Times Opinion,left,A Climate Hawk's Issues With Electric Vehicles,Peter Coy,7/14/2023,"I get why the Biden administration is pushing electric vehicles so hard. To stop the planet from overheating, we’ll eventually need motor vehicles to produce zero greenhouse gas emissions, and only fully electric vehicles can do that. Hybrids, which have combustion engines along with electric motors, will always puff some carbon dioxide (and other bad stuff) out of their tailpipes. Right now, though, there’s a good argument to be made that the government, and automakers, are leaning too hard into all-electric and neglecting the virtues of hybrid technology. When I first heard this counterintuitive argument from Toyota, I dismissed it as heel-dragging by a company that lags in electrics, but I’ve come around to the idea that hybrids — at least for now — do have a lot of advantages over all-electric vehicles. Imagine some wheelbarrows filled with rocks. The rocks contain lithium, cobalt, manganese, nickel, graphite and other materials for lithium-ion batteries. By Toyota’s calculation, the amount of rocks needed for one long-range electric vehicle would be enough for either six plug-in hybrids or 90 of the type of hybrid that can’t be plugged in for a recharge. (Namely, the type whose batteries are recharged from the engine or from braking.) “The overall carbon reduction of those 90 hybrids over their lifetimes is 37 times as much as a single battery electric vehicle,” Toyota argues. That’s a stunning statistic if true. “People involved in the auto industry are largely a silent majority,” Toyota’s then chief executive, Akio Toyoda, told reporters on a trip to Thailand in December, according to The Wall Street Journal. “That silent majority is wondering whether E.V.s are really OK to have as a single option. But they think it’s the trend so they can’t speak out loudly.” Lobbying against an all-electric approach is what you might expect from an automaker that bet heavily on hydrogen fuel cells and hybrids and has only a sliver of the market in E.V.s that run on batteries. I have no doubt that Toyota is motivated at least in part by self-interest. But some people I spoke with who aren’t connected with the company had similar views. “Toyota’s claim is accurate. We’ve crunched the numbers on this,” Ashley Nunes told me. He is a senior research associate at Harvard Law School and the director for federal policy, climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute, a think tank. He testified on the topic in April before the House Subcommittee on Environment, Manufacturing and Critical Materials. I’ll speed through his points. Electric vehicles consume huge quantities of lithium and other materials because they have huge batteries. And they have huge batteries because customers suffer from “range anxiety” and won’t buy an E.V. unless it can go for hundreds of miles without charging — even though the vast majority of trips are short. The Nissan Leaf gets 149 miles with its standard battery, which seems like enough for most purposes, yet Nissan sold just 12,026 Leafs (Leaves?) last year. Partly because of ever-bigger batteries, E.V. prices have grown on average, not shrunk as predicted. They are down a bit this year because of sales and lower chip prices. But they’ve been trending higher, and the cars remain too expensive for many buyers. Some people will keep driving old ICE-mobiles (cars with internal combustion engines) because they can’t afford an E.V. And those ICE-mobiles will continue to be major emitters of greenhouse gases. The production of electric vehicles produces more greenhouse gases than the production of cars with combustion engines. So E.V.s have to travel between 28,000 and 68,000 miles before they have an emissions advantage over similarly sized and equipped ICE-mobiles, according to Nunes. That may take 10 years or more if the E.V. isn’t driven much. Then there’s the problem of where to get all the minerals. Domestic production, even combined with extensive recycling, can’t meet the need for cobalt, graphite, lithium and manganese, Nunes wrote in his prepared House testimony. Allies could help, but they’re also ramping up consumption. “There is, to put it bluntly, only so much mineral supply to go around,” he wrote. Lithium iron phosphate is a promising alternative battery chemistry, but its energy density is lower, so batteries would have to be even bigger to give the same range. (Sodium-ion batteries and solid-state lithium-ion batteries are other options.) The Biden administration clearly doesn’t trust electric vehicles to win over the buying public purely on their merits. That’s why in April the Environmental Protection Agency proposed new rules to ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars and a quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032. That would be a wrenching change. It sometimes seems like E.V.s are everywhere, but in reality they accounted for just 5.8 percent of new cars sold in the United States last year, The Times reported. All-electric trucks accounted for less than 2 percent of new heavy trucks. Of course, drivers could be bribed into buying E.V.s if enough money were thrust in their faces. But Nunes said that greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced far more cost-effectively through subsidies of clean power generation, particularly wind turbines. For another perspective, I exchanged emails with Nafisa Lohawala, a Ph.D. economist who is a fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank. She focused on the benefits of plug-in hybrids, which use less metal than all-electric E.V.s but more than non-pluggable hybrids. “From consumers’ perspective,” she wrote, “having a gasoline backup helps alleviate range anxiety, allowing them to adopt plug-in hybrids even when the charging network around them is sparse. Moreover, given their lower price, middle- and low-income communities would also find adopting them easier than battery electric vehicles.” Lohawala wrote that if drivers recharge their plug-in hybrids frequently, they’ll be able to run on battery power almost all the time and emissions will be almost as low as with an all-electric E.V. That will tend to happen as more charging stations with faster chargers are installed. “As long as the battery ranges of plug-in hybrids are reasonably long and the electricity prices are low, consumers would voluntarily charge them rather than relying on gasoline,” she wrote. (That would only work for short trips, though.) Again, I get that climate change is an existential crisis. (Take it from my Opinion colleague, David Wallace-Wells.) I also get that hybrids aren’t as clean as all-electric E.V.s. “The fact is: A hybrid today is not green technology,” Katherine García, the director of the Clean Transportation for All Campaign, wrote last year. “The Prius hybrid runs on a pollution-emitting combustion engine found in any gas-powered car.” However, getting to the destination of all-electric for all will take more minerals, better battery chemistry and more and better chargers, among other things. That’s a big project. For now, hybrids seem like a valuable part of the vehicle mix."
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/27/opinion/electric-car-battery-range.html,The New York Times Opinion,left,You Want an Electric Car With a 300-Mile Range? When Was the Last Time You Drove 300 Miles?,Guest Essay,8/27/2022,"Throughout the history of America’s love affair with the car, nothing has succeeded quite like excess. Electric vehicles are heading down that same path. Give an E.V. a big enough battery and a fast-charging network, and suddenly you have the kind of vehicle we’ve always loved in this country: big, heavy, powerful and ready to head off into the sunset at a moment’s notice. If you’re lucky enough to drive one of the premium E.V.s that fits this description, you already may feel like your consumer desires are in perfect alignment with planetary environmental goals. ‌ After a decade of manufacturers selling E.V.s at luxury car prices, the government has made concerted efforts to get more people driving them. The recently signed Inflation Reduction Act offers extensive tax credits to buy both new and used E.V.s. California just announced that it intends to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles starting in 2035. However, these carrots and sticks merely tweak a fundamental approach to E.V. policy that has failed to achieve its goals. Rather than unleashing a mass market of affordable E.V.s, more than a decade of subsidies favoring large batteries has created an overheated market for premium E.V.s. A serious electrification policy will have to be tailored to the way we actually drive, not the way we think we do. Like almost all E.V.-related challenges, it comes down to the battery. Providing the power and range that have made E.V.s appealing to American buyers requires massive batteries, which help make the current crop of E.V.s, on average, around 30‌ percent more expensive than gas-powered cars. That problem will likely get worse as battery supply chain constraints make batteries more expensive, bucking past trends that have made them cheaper. The path to lower battery costs is extracting and processing minerals at a greater scale. Building out that kind of supply chain is slow, expensive and dangerous work, especially as America aims to become more independent of China’s battery supply chain dominance. Compared to the herculean task of building supply chains to sustain a broad domestic E.V. market, tackling this problem from the demand side almost seems easy. Proving that E.V.s can road trip may have been an important psychological hurdle for the technology to tackle, but it remains more psychological than real: the average American motorist drives about 40 miles per day and 95 percent of our car trips are 30 miles or shorter. We haven’t so much overcome this psychological hurdle as thrown big batteries at it, which is having a paradoxical (if predictable) effect of actually entrenching it. Despite dramatic growth in median E.V. range, to 234 miles in 2021 from 90 miles in 2015, consumer demand for range is always one step ahead. Three hundred miles might have been a desirable figure for potential E.V. buyers in 2019, but come 2021 it was 341 miles, according to findings from Cox Automotive. We could cater endlessly to this desire for more range without ever satiating it: More is always more, but more is also never enough. As much as these psychological challenges are born of American geography, history and mythology, they are also born of the unique attributes of gasoline. Rather than holding E.V. adoption hostage to our ability to make batteries match internal combustion in every way, government policy should focus on the cases where E.V.s have advantages that internal combustion will never match: waking up every morning with a full “tank” sufficient for daily commuting and errands. By improving home charging for urban apartment dwellers and prioritizing vehicles with smaller batteries, rather than road-trip-enabling charging stations and big batteries, we could maximize the miles we can affordably electrify. In an era of battery scarcity, we could have two 150-mile E.V.s for the battery capacity in every 300-mile E.V. Or, using the same 300-mile E.V. battery, you could have six plug-in hybrids with 50 miles of electric range for daily driving and a gasoline engine for those rarer road trips or many, many more e-bikes. For a century, Americans have had the luxury of choosing from a single, relatively uniform class of ‌vehicles designed to serve all of their transportation needs whether they live in a small town or a big city. Electrification replaces that simplicity with a wide variety of different options, each with advantages and disadvantages in different realms. Government policy should match a limited battery supply to where it can have the maximum impact for consumers and the environment. That means incentives for a wide variety of smaller-battery vehicles to electrify our most common transportation needs and for home charging for all levels of housing density. For some American households that may mean owning a single plug-in hybrid. For others that may mean a 150-mile E.V. for weekday miles and a hybrid truck for weekend projects and outdoor activities. Still other households might be able to serve their mobility needs with a mix of e-bikes, public transit and an occasional rental car. ‌All‌ of these options ‌are better at delivering short- and medium-term fleet electrification in an era of battery scarcity than simply waiting for batteries to become cheap enough for every American to own a 300-plus-mile E.V. The short time frame remaining to ‌limit climate change brings unique urgency to the electrification challenge, but freeing our thinking from a century of car-bred habits will be critical in countless new mobility technologies. Making the most of emerging technologies always starts with‌ understanding our needs and how best to meet them, not simply molding them into an image of the past. Figuring out how to grow the E.V. market across a decade of battery scarcity is only the most immediate opportunity to embrace this kind of challenge. How we face it will be telling."
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/opinion/electric-battery-energy-china.html,The New York Times Opinion,left,The U.S. Can Counter China's Control of Minerals for the Energy Transition,Guest Essay,11/6/2023,"China recently rattled the world’s electric vehicle supply chains by announcing new export controls on graphite, a key component of lithium-ion batteries. If China uses the export controls, which take effect on Dec. 1, to reduce exports of graphite or to favor Chinese-owned companies operating abroad, it could slow down efforts to scale up advanced battery manufacturing globally. Welcome to the geopolitics of the clean energy transition. Unlike in the 20th century, when China was largely a bystander in petroleum politics, the country has achieved new geopolitical significance by scaling up investments in clean energy manufacturing and the critical minerals that work requires. The supply chains for many critical minerals, not just graphite, run through China. In the case of materials critical to the production of lithium-ion batteries, which power electric vehicles, the consulting group Benchmark Mineral Intelligence estimated that China controlled 58 percent of the global production of lithium compounds in 2022, 69 percent of nickel sulfate, 69 percent of synthetic graphite, 75 percent of cobalt, 95 percent of manganese and 100 percent of spherical graphite. China plays a similarly outsize role in the supply of materials used in solar panels and wind turbines. But this isn’t simply a story about China’s geological good fortune. The country’s reserves of most of these minerals aren’t actually that large. Instead, it is a story of strategy. Over the past decade, China has systematically invested in overseas and domestic mines that feed into Chinese-owned refineries, where raw materials from around the world are processed into the high-grade materials needed for advanced manufacturing. China justified the new export controls on graphite as a national security measure. But most observers read China’s move as a warning shot in an increasingly high-stakes trade skirmish, as China, the United States and the European Union explore the new geopolitics of advanced manufacturing and a clean-energy transition. Three days before China announced the export controls on graphite, the Biden administration restricted exports of computer chips used in artificial intelligence applications to China. China’s leverage over the global critical minerals supply explains why the particulars of the Inflation Reduction Act are so important. The law, passed in August 2022, is not just the most consequential piece of climate and energy legislation in U.S. history; it is also designed to drive investment in domestic manufacturing and in supply chains that do an end run around China. It does this, in part, by providing generous incentives for domestic production of critical minerals, battery components and batteries. Consider its $7,500 tax credit toward electric vehicle purchases. For a vehicle to be eligible for the subsidy, in addition to meeting price caps, final assembly must take place in North America, and an increasing percentage of the critical minerals and battery components must be sourced from North America or, in the case of critical minerals, from free-trade partners. China does not have a free-trade agreement with the United States. The Treasury Department may also further limit the use of materials or components from China, depending on how it enforces the act’s restrictions on sourcing materials from a “foreign entity of concern.” In some respects, this law is working. Based on tracking I’ve undertaken with my students at Wellesley College, companies have announced $65.5 billion in investments since the act became law, including 15 new large-scale factories to produce batteries. If these projects all come online as planned, the United States will have enough battery manufacturing capacity to supply 14 million electric vehicles per year. What the Inflation Reduction Act hasn’t done, however, is spur similar investments in mining and minerals processing. Although it includes a 10 percent tax credit for critical minerals production (a category that includes graphite), about 2 percent of the newly announced investments are going toward mining and materials processing facilities. So as the United States expands investments in clean energy manufacturing, its dependency on global supply chains, dominated by China, will only grow. Building more diverse and resilient supply chains for critical minerals requires action at home and abroad. First, the United States needs to reduce the hurdles to investing in domestic mines and mineral processing facilities. While a new battery or E.V. factory can be brought online in a few years, identifying, permitting and commissioning mines and refineries often stretches out over a decade or more. Reforming permitting processes to ensure better engagement with local communities and expedited environmental reviews is urgently needed. Such reforms could help advance projects like Graphite One, a mine planned for Alaska’s Seward Peninsula. Second, the United States needs to support investments that diversify global supply chains. The Biden administration has begun laying the groundwork for such investments. In June 2022, it announced the Minerals Security Partnership, which includes promises of loan guarantees and debt financing and emphasizes the need for projects to benefit local communities and expand supplies of critical minerals from overseas. One potential project is a mine in Mozambique, which could supply graphite to the United States. What isn’t going to solve the supply problem, at least in the coming decades, is recycling. Given the global goals for scaling up clean-energy deployment, nowhere near enough of these critical minerals are available for recycling to meet the rapidly growing demand. The International Energy Agency forecasts that if the world is going to meet its most ambitious clean-energy goals by midcentury, production of critical minerals will need to increase to six times 2020 levels by 2040; graphite production will need to increase up to 25 times 2020 levels. Climate action can no longer be about phasing out fossil fuels alone. It must also be about phasing in a new set of extractive industries needed to enable a clean-energy transition. China figured this out a decade ago. The United States and its free-trade partners now face a monumental challenge: scaling up production of critical minerals, diversifying supply chains to protect national security and doing so in ways that are both more just and more sustainable. The place to begin is by reckoning with what it is going to take to build a clean-energy future, from the ground up. James Morton Turner is a professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College and the author, most recently, of “Charged: A History of Batteries and Lessons for a Clean Energy Future.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/11/opinion/letters/electric-cars.html,The New York Times Opinion,left,Electric Cars: How to Win Over Consumers,,9/11/2022,"This essay seems to hold a somewhat privileged view of cars and the role they play in today’s American families. No, we may not need to drive 300 miles very often — but when we need to drive that far, we often really need to go on that trip. A car that travels long distances enables us to attend funerals out of town, seek treatment for serious illness at faraway hospitals, take children on college trips or move across the country. Many people can’t afford to fly or take the train. A car is freedom, and limiting people to 300 or fewer miles between charges also limits their access to family, friends, education, job opportunities, nature, relaxation and more. I understand how difficult developing electric vehicles and their batteries can be. But think about the impact these charging limits would have on lower-income folks. How would they afford a small electric vehicle for daily use and a hybrid truck for long trips, as the essay suggests? Car manufacturers need to make vehicles that work for all, not just a privileged few. I agree with Edward Niedermeyer. If G.M. can sell a 260-mile electric car (the Bolt) for the mid-$20,000s after federal incentives, a 100-mile version of the car might come in under $15,000 and undercut every other vehicle on the market. That is when the E.V. “revolution” will really take off. Cheap, reliable urban vehicles are popular in Europe and could be superb commuter cars within dense urban areas in the United States. The subsidies in support of expensive electric vehicles have not brought down prices. Instead, with supply chain constraints, prices are rising. Edward Niedermeyer writes that “the path to lower battery costs is extracting and processing minerals at a great scale.” I have some news. We can’t just dig our way out of this problem. We need to attack it the old-fashioned American way: Invent our way out. This means devise a new battery chemistry that requires no cobalt, no nickel, no manganese and no lithium, but instead is made of substances that are earth-abundant and readily available here in North America. It’s time to stop propping up the tired 30-year-old lithium-ion battery technology as a key enabler of the green transition. Invented in America, sourced in America and made in America: That’s the prescription for independence from Chinese battery supply chain dominance. People who live in Mountain States or the Great Plains routinely drive three-digit distances. Have you looked at the Dakotas? Nebraska? Colorado? Texas? The prospect of grinding to a halt in the middle of, say, Montana or Nevada is guaranteed to cancel the appeal of a short-run E.V. Consider, too, Midwestern winters with their occasional blizzards. Even though you’d avoid traveling in such weather, sometimes you don’t have a choice (a birth, or a death …). Who wants to be stranded in a whiteout on a closed interstate in Kansas? Not my preferred way to die. Recharging stations are nearly nonexistent in many areas of the sprawling West and Midwest. Until they become ubiquitous, there is a market for those big batteries. I agree that the 300-mile-range battery is the wrong goal. Here is a thought experiment. Would that battery capacity still be the automobile industry’s goal if a rail system adequately met the average family’s needs for more extended travel? In other countries, trains provide the capability to make extended travel possible without using the family automobile. In the United States, such a rail system would result in the 300-mile battery serving only a small niche market, not the mass market goal currently pursued. It is the current inadequacies of our long-distance public transport that helps fuel the automobile industry’s battery pursuits. Re “Paddling Makes a Comeback in Missouri” (news article, Aug. 29): Let me understand this: Institutions of learning are teaching children what? Oh, OK, I get it now. Hitting a child with a wooden paddle is the way to teach them to behave and show respect. Does it work? No. Countless scientific studies have shown that physical punishment is not effective. Humiliation and pain lead to alienation, bitterness and revenge — not increased self-control, cooperation and empathy. So, in whose interest is this brutality? Perhaps frustrated teachers and parents gain relief by administering corporal punishment. (How does this square with anti-bullying campaigns? Oh, wait, it doesn’t.) For starters, what about investing in adequate mental health services, offering parent education programs, and training teachers in effective classroom management techniques? Children benefit more from a helping hand than from a striking one. Re “A Fair Auctioned a Beloved Goat. Its Owners Filed a Federal Lawsuit” (news article, Sept. 4): I am the executive director of Woodstock Farm Sanctuary, a home to 400 rescued farmed animals in the Hudson Valley. I’ve been following the story of Cedar, the goat who was seized and killed after the young girl who raised him through a 4-H program to be auctioned at the Shasta District Fair wanted to save his life and keep him safe. I am saddened but not surprised by the outcome. There are so many accounts of traumatized children trying to save the lives of the animals they raised in 4-H, as well as of adults who are still haunted by the memories of the animals who trusted them and were auctioned off to be killed. Woodstock Sanctuary is leading a coalition of farmed animal sanctuaries around the country to educate the public about state and county fairs and their role in perpetuating the myths that animal farming is good and natural and without victims. Cedar and the child who raised him for auction and then changed her mind after she developed a friendship with him are both victims of 4-H and the Shasta District Fair. I hope Cedar’s friend gets some peace knowing that she tried to save his life, and I’m so sorry this happened to them both. The unfairness of slaughtering a child’s beloved pet reminds me of Fern Arable in “Charlotte’s Web” when she saw her father heading to the hoghouse with his ax: “This is the most terrible case of injustice I ever heard of.” Out of the mouth of a fictional 8-year-old came wisdom. Thank you, E.B. White."
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/10/opinion/federal-investment-green-energy-global-warming.html,The New York Times Opinion,left,Giving Red America a Reason to Love Electric Vehicles,Binyamin Appelbaum,6/10/2023,"Electric vehicles are rare in Moses Lake, Wash., a small city in the fertile Columbia Basin about a three-hour drive east of Seattle. In that conservative farms-and-factories community, few people have the cash or the inclination. The only electric vehicle I saw during a two-day visit last month was a Tesla in the hotel parking lot. Over the next few years, however, hundreds of Moses Lake residents are going to be entering the electric vehicle business. Two different companies, attracted by cheap hydropower, are opening plants there, each backed by $100 million in federal money, to produce a key ingredient for electric vehicle batteries. The investment is part of the roughly half a trillion dollars the Biden administration is marshaling to transform an economy fueled by carbon into one fueled by clean, renewable energy, and it illustrates a gamble at the heart of that broader effort. Instead of delivering electric vehicles, solar panels and other green technologies at the lowest possible cost, no matter their country of origin, the Biden administration is determined to use this opportunity to expand domestic manufacturing. And it is concentrating much of that effort in rural and Rust Belt communities, where reactionary politics have taken hold most strongly. The plan to combat global warming is also a bid for industrial revival and a transformed political landscape. There is a real risk that President Biden’s economic and political aims will come into conflict with his environmental goals. If domestic production results in higher costs, that could suppress demand for electric vehicles. Political opposition to renewable energy, on the rise in many conservative communities, could impede production. But giving people an economic stake in the transition to green energy may well be the nation’s best chance to build a durable political consensus in favor of confronting global warming. The novelist Upton Sinclair observed, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.” Well, the opposite is true, too. In Moses Lake, where one city official described the local version of the American dream to me as “house-boat-truck,” it is possible to imagine that one day in the not-too-distant future, workers at the battery plants will be driving electric pickups. The environmental case for investing 200 million tax dollars in Moses Lake is that gas-powered vehicles produce 24 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, and persuading consumers to drive electric vehicles instead is going to require a lot of batteries that are more powerful and more affordable than what’s available today. Right now, almost all electric vehicles are powered by batteries that use graphite to store electricity. Scientists have long known that silicon can hold more energy than graphite. But silicon swells as it charges, with results much like a soda can left in a freezer. The two companies building factories in Moses Lake, Sila Nanotechnologies and Group14 Technologies, make specially modified forms of silicon that solve the swelling problem. Batteries using the special sand can propel vehicles up to 20 percent farther than existing batteries. Recharging is a lot faster, too. At Group14’s first plant, outside Seattle, trays of carbon that look like badly burned brownies emerge from a long oven and are milled into a powder so fine that a thimbleful could coat a hockey rink. The key to Group14’s technology is that each of those tiny grains of carbon is about two-thirds air, like a very porous sponge or a coral reef. The grains are then placed in a chamber of silane, a gaseous form of silicon, which fills about half of their interiors, leaving room for expansion when the silicon is charged. The resulting black powder is shipped to battery plants, where it will be painted onto thin strips of metal and stacked inside batteries. Sila, which uses a different process to reach similar ends, has its own small factory at its Bay Area headquarters. Together, the two companies make enough powder to power a few hundred vehicles per year. The factories in Moses Lake, which together will cost more than $700 million, will each produce enough for about 200,000 vehicles a year. Group14 has signed Porsche as an investor and a customer; Sila is working with Mercedes-Benz. Both companies say they would have moved ahead even without direct federal funding. But the money does mean that they can grow faster. Rick Luebbe, the chief executive of Group14, said the company was able to raise additional capital on the back of the federal money, allowing it to build two production lines in Moses Lake rather than one. “It’s a validation for people who want to work for us, for people who want to support us, and for customers,” he said. It would take 400 more factories the size of the ones in Moses Lake to make enough silicon to power all the vehicles produced in an average year. But the government isn’t betting just on silicon. It is simultaneously funding an even bigger expansion of graphite manufacturing at factories in Georgia, Louisiana and Tennessee. It’s also backing companies pursuing other alternatives to graphite, and other potential breakthroughs in battery technology. The government is trying to pick winners only in the sense that it wants the next big idea in batteries to be made in the United States. Backing domestic production marks a break with decades of federal economic policy that treated low prices as the primary goal, and imports as the best way to achieve that goal. In 2005, for example, the government introduced tax credits for the installation of solar panels, without restrictions on the country of origin. Over the next six years, imports of Chinese solar panels increased to $2.7 billion a year, up from $21 million a year. Chinese companies also have raced ahead in the market for electric vehicle batteries, but the Biden administration is hoping to leapfrog them by investing in a new generation of ideas. China controls three-quarters of the world’s supply of graphite, but “our technology requires sand and energy,” said Gene Berdichevsky, the chief executive of Sila. “Those can be sourced in quite a lot of places.” The federal government is also rigging the competition against Chinese producers. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, passed last year, buyers of electric vehicles are eligible for tax credits of up to $7,500. But as of April 18, the credit is available only if at least half of the value of the vehicle’s battery was produced in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and at least 40 percent of the minerals were produced in the United States or by an approved list of allies. Over the next few years, those requirements will gradually rise to 100 percent for the battery and 80 percent for the minerals. Other subsidies could take an additional $9,000 off the price of cars with American batteries. The incentives are enough that for the first time, some electric vehicles are now cheaper than comparable gas-powered cars. The residents of Moses Lake are eagerly anticipating the benefits. Adan Lopez, 20, is studying physics at Big Bend Community College in Moses Lake. He isn’t sure whether he wants to stay in the area. “Jobs are kind of limited around here,” he said. “If you want to do anything, people have to go to Spokane or Seattle.” Brant Mayo, executive director of the Grant County Economic Development Council, said the Moses Lake region has been chasing factories since the early 1990s to bring higher-paying jobs to the area. “We want our kids and our grandkids, if they want to be in the area, to have an opportunity to do whatever they want here,” he said. Factories also attract factories. After Microsoft opened a data center in the nearby town of Quincy, a company that makes plastic conduits for data centers opened a 50-employee operation. Three electrical firms also have opened offices. The potential costs of trying to orchestrate economic development are less obvious and less concentrated, and thus easier to ignore. But they could easily outweigh the benefits. Government investment can allow companies to take risks that investors wouldn’t support, but it also can insulate companies from market discipline, propping up underperforming technologies and preventing better ideas from gaining traction. Preserving factory jobs also is expensive, and higher costs could slow the adoption of electric vehicles. It costs about twice as much to build a battery plant in the United States as in China, according to one recent estimate. The urgency of global warming means that the Biden administration may be gambling with time it can’t afford to lose. Moses Lake, population 26,040, was created by federal investment. The area was a sparsely populated desert until the damming of the Columbia River began in the 1930s. The Democratic Party’s vision of cheap power and water created one of the nation’s most productive farming regions, famous for its apples and potatoes. But the city and the surrounding region are now “bright red,” in the words of Steve Starr, the lonesome chairman of the local Democratic Party. Mr. Starr is skeptical that this new season of federally funded economic growth will make a difference. Other issues loom larger. At the county fairgrounds, the Democrats have a building with a big sign out front reminding visitors about the government’s role in the region’s history. The Republican Party’s building, just across the way, has a large sign declaring opposition to abortion. Mr. Starr also says the government’s role in the current factory boom is easy for people to ignore. Instead of public works, the government is backing private companies. The sign in front of Group14’s future factory doesn’t have any mention of federal funding. “Without the federal government this would be an uninhabited desert, but you won’t hear Republicans here say that,” Mr. Starr said. “Are people going to accept the idea that Biden, through federal government initiatives, is helping our economy? My answer is, sadly, probably not.” Some Republicans insist they don’t want the help. The congressman who represents Moses Lake, Dan Newhouse, joined all but a few of his Republican colleagues in voting against the 2021 legislation that is providing funding for the battery plants, and against the 2022 bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, that is providing an even larger block of funding for similar projects. In April, he voted for the House debt ceiling bill that would have rolled back much of that federal funding. Electric vehicles, in particular, are becoming a partisan battleground. Republican lawmakers in Wyoming introduced a resolution this year calling for the state to ban the sale of electric vehicles by 2035 to “ensure the stability of Wyoming’s oil and gas industry.” The resolution, which did not pass, directed Wyoming’s secretary of state to send a copy to the governor of California, which has a law banning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles starting in 2035. In Moses Lake, the most likely flashpoint is access to power. The cheap, green electricity from two Columbia River dams is still the community’s greatest asset and it remains under public control. It is the most important reason Group14 and Sila both chose to build factories here. But there is not enough of it. The local utility, the Grant County Public Utility District, says that it expects to begin buying electricity from outside the county by 2025. For the battery plants, or other factories, to grow here, the community is going to have to invest in expanding its supply of renewable energy. Richard Hanover grew up in Moses Lake and now works as the director of development at the Port of Moses Lake, which controls much of the region’s industrial land. When he was a child, he said, it didn’t seem possible Moses Lake would ever have a chance at the kind of prosperity that is now within reach. “It wasn’t even possible when I started here nine years ago,” he said. Now it is. Will Moses Lake seize the opportunity?"
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/24/opinion/electric-vehicle-tesla-hybrid.html,The New York Times Opinion,left,"Relax, Electric Vehicles Really Are the Best Choice for the Climate",Stephen Porder,11/24/2023,"It has been a bumpy few weeks for carmakers who sell electric vehicles, which are moving more slowly off the lot than they were earlier this year. What’s going on? It seems that American drivers may be more hesitant about E.V.s than automakers expected. I am familiar with trepidation about electric vehicles; I hear it when I give talks around the country about how each of us can take small steps to slow and stop climate change, when I chat with my neighbors and when I go on a road trip in my own E.V. Some people worry about running out of battery power far from a charging station; others are dissuaded by the upfront costs. The electric Volkswagen ID. 4, for example, sells for about $40,000, while the similarly sized, gas-powered Volkswagen Tiguan sells for about $30,000 — though the E.V. has a lower total cost over the life of the car. Those concerns will likely diminish in 2024 as money from the Inflation Reduction Act flows into building more charging stations and making discounts for electric vehicles available right at the dealership. But I think something else may explain why so many Americans, including those who consider themselves climate conscious, have been hesitant to buy an electric vehicle. It’s a fear that such vehicles aren’t really all that much better for the environment than hybrid vehicles that have both gas and electric motors, and might even be worse, because of everything required to manufacture batteries and mine the materials that go into them. This worry is keeping some would-be buyers on the sidelines of the E.V. revolution. If you look under the hood, so to speak, these concerns share two fundamental misunderstandings: They assume that the electric vehicle industry is locked in to today’s technology, and they discount the huge environmental drawbacks of gas-powered alternatives. Electric vehicles are like digital cameras in their early iterations. They are already better than the alternative for almost everyone, and improving at a breathtakingly fast clip. And while there are environmental concerns with them, they are dwarfed by the benefit they provide regarding climate change — the biggest environmental threat to human well-being in the 21st century. Let’s start with the concern about emissions during battery construction, a topic that comes up in almost every talk I give on this subject. Electric vehicle batteries require a lot of materials and electricity to manufacture, and that process does produce more greenhouse gas emissions than not making a battery. But let’s do the math as I’ve done for my family’s two E.V.s. We got the first to replace our 10-year-old, gas-powered Subaru, and after only two years of driving, the E.V. has created fewer emissions over its lifetime than if we had kept the old car. It will take our second E.V. only four years to create fewer emissions over its lifetime than the 2005 hybrid Prius it replaced. That’s counting the production of the batteries and the emissions from charging the E.V.s, and the emissions payback time will only continue to drop as more emissions-free wind and solar power comes onto the grid and battery technology improves. My colleague Yue Qi, a battery researcher, recently told me, “Every prediction made 10 years ago about the change in price, efficiency and energy density of batteries was too pessimistic.” For instance, an assessment from the Argonne National Laboratory found that the lifetime emissions of E.V.s dropped 40 percent between 2015 and 2020. Even 2020 is ancient history when you look at another oft-cited concern — that we will run out of materials like lithium, cobalt and nickel to make batteries. Here again, it’s a mistake to think present constraints will continue into the future given that the price of lithium has fallen roughly 70 percent from its high in 2022. Cobalt, another key component of batteries, has been in the public eye because of its scarcity and the horrific working conditions for miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Those conditions need to be addressed, but it’s a mistake to view them in isolation. Oil extraction has its own horrific human and environmental costs, as does climate change. In my view, relying on gas cars over electric vehicles is the bigger contributor to environmental injustice. Happily, an increasing number of E.V.s, including those of Tesla and the Chinese automaker BYD, no longer use cobalt in their batteries in most markets because the performance of cobalt-free alternatives is rapidly improving. Within a decade, many batteries may be built with sodium in place of lithium, a trend already accelerating in China, the world’s biggest market for electric vehicles. Again, our present concerns will most likely fade in the near future. After batteries, the second most common question that comes up is about plug-in hybrids, which are cars that can run for about 25 to 50 miles on a smallish battery and then switch to a gas engine for longer trips. You might think that that’s a pretty good compromise — most car trips in the United States are, after all, under 25 miles, and if everyone had a plug-in hybrid, a vast majority of trips would be solely battery powered. But what matters for emissions is not trips but miles, and long trips are where we really pile on the miles. That means about half of all miles driven in plug-in hybrids would still be driven using gas on long trips. Thus, buying a hybrid, rather than an electric vehicle, perpetuates our dependence on gas production and distribution, slowing — rather than hastening — the transition to a zero-emissions future. Simply put, we can’t solve the climate crisis if we keep our gas infrastructure; only fully electric vehicles (coupled with clean electricity) can eliminate emissions from our cars. Even without considering climate, anyone who has already switched to an electric vehicle knows it is more fun to drive, and saves time. My family doesn’t have to spend time charging our E.V. every week for the simple reason that we charge our vehicle overnight at home and wake up to a full battery. And because electric vehicles have fewer parts — no gas tank, no exhaust system, no catalytic converter, no radiator, no fuel injector, no timing belt — downtime for repairs is practically eliminated. Given all the benefits of electric vehicles, it’s clear they should be the next car purchased by a vast majority of American drivers. And getting over our uncertainty is one of the biggest steps we can take toward a safer climate future."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/opinion/electric-cars-SUV.html,The New York Times Opinion,left,There's One Big Problem With Electric Cars,,2/18/2021,"They’re still cars. Technology can’t cure America of its addiction to the automobile. Credit...Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times I am starting to worry about the electric car. Not the thing itself; I’ve found electric vehicles to be superior to their fossil-powered predecessors in just about every important way, and although I am a car-crazy Californian, I don’t expect to buy a lung-destroying, pollution-spewing gas car ever again. But electric motors are merely a power source, not a panacea. From General Motors’ Super Bowl ads to President Biden’s climate-change plans, plug-in cars are now being cast as a central player in America’s response to a warming future — turning a perfectly reasonable technological hope into overblown hype. The planet will be much better off if we switch to electric cars. But gauzy visions of the guilt-free highways of tomorrow could easily distract us from the larger and more entrenched problem with America’s transportation system. That problem isn’t just gas-fueled cars but car-fueled lives — a view of the world in which huge private automobiles are the default method of getting around. In this way E.V.s represent a very American answer to climate change: To deal with an expensive, dangerous, extremely resource-intensive machine that has helped bring about the destruction of the planet, let’s all buy this new version, which runs on a different fuel. But while we go about the project of building electric cars into tomorrow’s infrastructure — Biden has pledged to create a network of 500,000 charging stations around the country and replace the roughly 650,000 cars in the federal government’s fleet with E.V.s — let’s not overlook a more immediate menace on the roads today. I refer to the millions of big, inefficient trucks and S.U.V.s that are America’s favorite cars, each poisoning our atmosphere for years beyond any transition to E.V.s. The promise of electric cars grants us a little leeway to party on in the gas-guzzling present — E.V.s offer a politically simple, one-stop expiation for our unsustainable ways, so long as we all ignore the Escalade in the room. Fixing the problems caused by cars with new and improved cars and expensive new infrastructure just for cars illustrates why we’re in this mess in the first place — an entrenched culture of careless car dependency. Liberation from car culture requires a more fundamental reimagining of how we get around, with investments in walkable and bike-able roadways, smarter zoning that lets people live closer to where they work, a much greater emphasis on public transportation and above all a recognition that urban space should belong to people, not vehicles. Policy changes that reduce the amount Americans drive could lead to far greater efficiency gains than we’d get just from switching from gas to batteries. During his time as mayor of South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg, the new secretary of transportation, advocated plans to reduce car dependency. But asking Americans to begin to imagine a future of fewer, smaller cars and less driving will be a great political heave. I can already imagine the Fox News segments pillorying Biden and Mayor Pete for their “war” on S.U.V.s and pickup trucks. I too might sound like a mirthless environmental scold. But perhaps we all need a little scolding. Between 2009 and 2019, the average fuel economy across all vehicles increased only slightly, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Our cars were getting an average of 22.4 miles per gallon in 2009, and by 2019 efficiency had grown to 24.9 m.p.g., a gain of about 11 percent. We could have done much better, with efficiency rising perhaps as much as 4 percent or 5 percent a year, John DeCicco, a research professor emeritus at the University of Michigan Energy Institute, told me. After fuel economy standards were raised under George W. Bush and then even more under Barack Obama, manufacturers began installing a host of new technologies to make cars more efficient. Most vehicle types became significantly cleaner — average fuel economy for sedans, for instance, grew to 30.9 m.p.g. in 2019 from 25.3 m.p.g. in 2009, a gain of about 22 percent. So how did most cars get so much better without changing the bigger picture very much at all? It’s simple, DeCicco says: We ate our gains. As cars became more efficient, people began buying larger, heavier and more powerful cars. In particular, we got hooked on sport utility vehicles and those formless blobs on wheels known as crossovers, which became one of the hottest segments of the car business. A decade ago, about half of all cars sold were sedans, which are some of the most efficient vehicles on the road, and about a quarter were S.U.V.s, which are some of the least efficient. By 2019 only a third of cars sold were sedans, and about half were small or large S.U.V.s. Given more efficient cars, we bought more car. Federal policy hasn’t helped. In 2017 the Trump administration began to undo Obama’s fuel rules, a reversal that fostered uncertainty and division in the car industry and perhaps pushed carmakers to lay off new fuel-saving technologies. The growing adoption of electric vehicles over the last decade did little to counteract these larger forces; any environmental benefits we got from zero-emission E.V.s were swamped by the much larger market shift toward bigger cars. While electric cars are important, DeCicco wrote recently on his blog, “much more stringent clean car standards are the real priority for putting the U.S. automobile fleet on track for climate protection.” Naturally, the car industry is not in favor of significantly stricter fuel standards. Carmakers expect Biden to raise fuel standards, but they are pushing for something less than the Obama rules, which would have required passenger vehicles to achieve an average of 54.5 m.p.g. by 2025. Among environmentalists, there is more than a little suspicion that the flurry of new electric vehicle announcements — including G.M.’s pledge to sell only zero-emission passenger cars by 2035 — is a negotiating tactic to forestall very tough fuel standards. Carmakers will gladly give us some awesome E.V.s tomorrow for lenient rules today. There’s a chance I’m being overly cynical. To the car industry’s credit, the push for electric vehicles does appear to be real. Carmakers are investing hundreds of billions of dollars to bring about the electric future, and in the next few years they plan to release dozens of electric models. Ford, for instance, is pumping electrons into its most iconic models — an electric Mustang, the Mach-E, was just introduced to positive reviews, and the F-150 pickup truck, for decades the best-selling vehicle in America, will be offered in an electric version next year. But it’s worth remembering that the electric future is still just a vision, not a certainty. The car industry’s electric dreams are fueled by a singular success — Tesla, Elon Musk’s electric-car juggernaut. In a pandemic-crushed market otherwise brutal for the car industry, Tesla shipped just shy of half a million vehicles in 2020, about a third more than it sold in 2019. But no other carmaker has found much luck in electric vehicles, and serious questions about the business remain. Will E.V.s become cheap and convenient enough to attract a mainstream audience? Can carmakers that now rely on big pickups and S.U.V.s for their profits make money on the electric models? How should we address the inequities in the market? At the moment, electric cars are still pricier than gas-powered alternatives, and the $7,500 federal credit on their sales is essentially a subsidy for rich people. Is that the best use of transportation funds? And what do we do about gas-powered cars? You may have seen that bizarre G.M. Super Bowl ad in which Will Ferrell and his celebrity pals invade Norway because it has been wildly successful at selling electric vehicles. What the ad doesn’t mention is the reason so many Norwegians are buying E.V.s: The country has imposed steep taxes on gas-powered cars, accelerating the transformation to a cleaner future. Should we follow its lead? All of these questions will affect the viability of the electric car business. Note that even Tesla has never made a profit just by selling cars. The company has amassed oodles of zero-emission regulatory credits that it sells to other carmakers; in 2020, Tesla brought in more than $1.6 billion through credits, without which its business would have posted a net loss. Then there are all the problems with cars that electric motors won’t fix. Cars have insatiable demand for roadway and urban space, capturing our cities for their near-exclusive use. They are expensive and inefficient — the ridiculous notion of paying thousands of dollars a year for a machine that’s mostly parked is no less ridiculous because the car is being charged while it’s parked. And whether our cars are powered by electrons or petroleum, it’s likely that more than a million people around the world will keep dying in crashes every year. Can we fix these issues with more advanced tech? Perhaps, someday. But we’d make better progress if we identified the correct problem: not gas, but cars."
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/18/opinion/a-brighter-future-for-electric-cars-and-the-planet.html,The New York Times Opinion,left,A Brighter Future for Electric Cars and the Planet,The Editorial Board,7/18/2017,"There is simply no credible way to address climate change without changing the way we get from here to there, meaning cars, trucks, planes and any other gas-guzzling forms of transportation. That is why it is so heartening to see electric cars, considered curios for the rich or eccentric or both not that long ago, now entering the mainstream. A slew of recent announcements by researchers, auto companies and world leaders offer real promise. First up, a forecast by Bloomberg New Energy Finance said that electric cars would become cheaper than conventional cars without government subsidies between 2025 and 2030. At the same time, auto companies like Tesla, General Motors and Volvo are planning a slate of new models that they say will be not only more affordable but also more practical than earlier versions. And officials in such countries as France, India and Norway have set aggressive targets for putting these vehicles to use and phasing out emission-spewing gasoline and diesel cars. Skeptics may see these announcements as wishful thinking. After all, just 1.1 percent of all cars sold globally in 2016 were electrics or plug-in hybrids. And many popular models still cost much more than comparable fossil-fuel cars. The skeptics, however, have consistently been overly pessimistic about this technology. Electric cars face challenges, yet they have caught on much faster than was thought likely just a few years ago. There were two million of them on the world’s roads last year, up 60 percent from 2015, according to the International Energy Agency. The cost of batteries, the single most expensive component of the cars, fell by more than half between 2012 and 2016, according to the Department of Energy. Tesla has indicated that it can produce batteries for about $125 per kilowatt-hour. Researchers say the cost of electric cars will be at parity with conventional vehicles when battery prices reach $100 per kilowatt-hour, which experts say is just a few years away. Electric cars are more efficient, of course, but they also require less maintenance, which should make them cheaper to own over time. The potential environmental benefits of electric vehicles are huge. The transportation sector accounts for 14 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and 27 percent of emissions in the United States. Moreover, countries have found it much more difficult to reduce planet-warming gases from transportation than from power plants. In America, for example, transportation emissions again regularly exceed those from the electricity sector for the first time since the late 1970s. The switch to electric cars is good for the climate because petroleum vehicles produce more greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than power plants fueled by natural gas, according to the Energy Information Administration. Proponents say the growth of electric cars, when combined with the surge in renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, could lead to big reductions in emissions over time. These forces should also help reduce local air pollution in countries like China and India, which is why their leaders are getting behind these technologies in a big way. Government incentives have turned China into the biggest market for electric vehicles. And an Indian government minister says his country wants all cars sold there by 2030 to be electric. France says it wants to end sales of new diesel and gasoline cars by 2040, while Norway’s goal is 2025. Government support could prove as crucial to the future of the technology as technical advances. If countries, states and localities encourage the spread of public charging stations, through tax breaks, other incentives or public spending, more people will take the plunge and convert. If the United States and other governments continue to spend money on research to help drive down battery costs, their economies and consumers will benefit. Some parts of the fossil fuel industry will no doubt try to sabotage the electric car revolution. In the United States, the industry is lobbying states to eliminate subsidies for the vehicles. And many analysts expect the industry to seek similar changes at the federal level from President Trump and Republican leaders in Congress, who have already made clear that they do not see climate change as a major threat. They should know, though, that the most they can do is slow down the process. The electric car has already left the garage."

Also: Attacks on women in New York; putting science to work. Re “G.M. Phasing Out Cars and Trucks Using Gas by 2035” (front page, Jan. 29): Bravo to General Motors for leading automakers toward an all-electric future. But even as more follow suit, let’s remember that electric vehicles are only as clean as their energy sources. And these sources will continue to extract energy from carbon-polluting fuels so long as our markets neglect their true costs to society. We must urge Congress to fix this market problem. Before us are legislative solutions like the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, which places a fee on carbon pollution and returns the collected money back to Americans. If enacted, this policy will help put tailpipe emissions in our rearview mirrors for good, and clean up the energy sources that propel us forward. General Motors’ transition to an all-electric fleet is a critical step toward addressing the risks of global warming. But a large solar storm or electromagnetic pulse event could disable the entire transportation structure for months. True resilience is enhanced through diversity, in both power sources and engine types. Otherwise, the only vehicles left on the road will be a ’56 Chevy and a few riding lawn mowers. Owning an electric car is great if you live in a house where you can plug the car in each night to recharge the battery. But what about the tens of thousands of New Yorkers who live in an apartment building? What are we supposed to do? Throw a long extension cord out a window? And that’s assuming we could get a parking space below the window — a very rare possibility. Re “Woman After Woman Was Attacked Near a Subway Stop. Police Kept Quiet” (news article, Feb. 5): I have worked on improving the New York Police Department’s response to gender-based crimes since 1978. Your article reveals multiple policing weaknesses. First, after the second attack, with no apparent motive, on women, someone at the Police Department should have wondered if women were in danger at the subway station in question. Instead, shoddy investigative work failed to identify the perpetrator after the first attacks. A lack of coordination between the precinct and the N.Y.P.D.’s Transit Bureau led each to believe that fewer attacks had taken place. Warnings to the public were delayed, and there was a failure to respond to a 911 call reporting a similar crime. A case with so many systemic flaws should be examined step by step. This review must be conducted with experts from outside the Police Department, with meaningful policy changes adopted and those changes reported to the public. As President Biden rallies forces to confront climate change, he looks to science for results. Science provides the means for consensus through facts and evidence-based solutions to overcome the divisive issues facing our country, from the pandemic to climate change, racial inequity and economic disparity. The logical next step for the Biden administration is to call a Science Summit to attract experts from across the American spectrum. Participants should include scientists who work in government, but also leaders in business and industry, academia and NGOs. Let’s bring together experts in mathematics, physics, psychology, economics, education, medicine, public health, engineering and technology. Their combined knowledge will equip the Biden administration to tackle our country’s problems, while uniting Americans behind a common vision for progress."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/opinion/electric-cars-climate-change.html,The New York Times Opinion,left,"Even for Bargain Hunters, Green Cars Make Sense",Margaret Renkl,1/25/2021,"In this family, we are not new-car people. My husband and I buy used vehicles, and we keep them until the cost of patching them up far exceeds their value, a time-honored practice known as driving a car into the ground. We don’t drive a lot, either: My husband works a mile and a half from our house, and I work from a home office. I kept thinking about electric cars anyway. We didn’t actually need a new vehicle when we started shopping. My 2006 minivan was working fine, and my husband’s 2001 minivan was working fine, too. But it was 2019, and our youngest child was a junior in college. We had long since aged out of the minivan cohort. Meanwhile, evidence of the growing climate calamity was becoming clearer and grimmer with every new study — and with every wildfire, every drought, every hurricane — even as the Trump administration kept rolling back environmental protections at a breathtaking rate. I felt a rising desperation to do everything possible to reduce my own carbon footprint, to foster as much biodiversity as I could on my own little half-acre plot of ground. The earth cannot be saved by personal actions alone, but there are many practical ways a person can help the environment anyway: lowering the thermostat, buying organics, eating less meat, skipping the lawn-care chemicals, planting native shrubs and trees, buying carbon offsets, subscribing to a renewable energy program, eliminating single-use plastics and other disposables. All of those changes, and many others, are important because they mean treading a bit more lightly on a suffering earth. But the single greatest change we can make is to change the way we get around. “Transportation is the largest source of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the United States today, and the bulk of those emissions come from driving in our cities and suburbs,” as Nadja Popovich and Denise Lu noted in a feature for The Times last fall. According to their interactive map, total greenhouse emissions rose 88 percent in Nashville from 1990 to 2017, and that’s not simply because of population growth. Per-person emissions were up 9 percent in the same time frame. Never mind the environment: At this rate, Nashvillians will soon find it difficult to breathe. No doubt we already do. Data collected during the pandemic quarantines last spring suggest that deaths in the United States from illnesses like asthma, lung disease and heart disease dropped by roughly 25 percent because of the improvement in air quality while fewer vehicles were on the roads. Biking and walking are the most ecologically sound ways to get around, of course, and taking public transportation is second best. But if, like my family, you live in a place with a profoundly limited public-transportation system and few pedestrian-friendly streets, driving is a necessary evil. If you have to go somewhere, an electric vehicle is the third-best way to get there. The cost of an electric car can be prohibitive, it’s true, or at least it can appear to be from a glance at the window sticker. But we chose a Nissan Leaf, a vehicle made by our neighbors down in Smyrna, Tenn., and the model we bought qualified for the highest possible federal tax credit. So the actual cost of our car was $7,500 less than the price we paid for it, even if it didn’t seem that way when we signed the papers. Besides the tax credit — which varies from vehicle to vehicle and has already expired on some of the most popular models, including all Teslas — electric cars are less expensive to maintain. A new analysis by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that the total cost of ownership is actually lower for many electric vehicles, over the lifetime of the car, than for their combustion engine equivalents. And from an environmental standpoint, there’s no comparison at all, even factoring in the higher emissions involved in producing an electric vehicle’s giant battery. None of these things matter if you can’t afford to buy a car. So many people are struggling to pay for food right now that it feels unseemly to be discussing the economy of electric cars. But if the time is coming when you’ll need to purchase a car anyway, or if you’re the kind of consumer who tends to drive a car into the ground but can afford to rethink that policy, driving an electric vehicle has become a more practical option than you might realize. Even without the tax credit, many upcoming models are projected to cost no more than their carbon-spewing counterparts. The number of purchase options is about to explode, too, so you don’t have to give your money to Elon Musk if you want to drive an electric vehicle. It’s true that it can take some planning to keep the car charged. We don’t have a garage, so we can’t charge our Leaf if it rains, and even with a battery range of more than 200 miles, this car will never be our go-to vehicle for road trips. When public chargers become more plentiful, as they must for electric vehicles to become truly ubiquitous, there will still be the matter of how long they take to charge. The most powerful charger publicly available still needs close to an hour to charge our car’s drained battery, and the most powerful charger on the market isn’t available at the average highway exit. But none of these potential liabilities should be deal breakers. I love our little red Leaf, and I have never had a single moment of buyer’s remorse since we brought it home. It’s quiet, it’s comfortable, and it’s amazingly fun to drive. Like every other vehicle we have owned, we expect to keep it for another 12 or 15 years. All I can hope is that by the time we need to replace it, all our options will be electric. Because if they aren’t, the planet will pay a terrible price."
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/electric-vehicle-demand-falls-short-manufacturer-dealership-expectations,Fox News,right,Electric vehicle demand falls short of manufacturer and dealership expectations,Bret Baier,11/28/2023,"Electric vehicle sales have risen significantly over the years. That trend is expected to continue with the market on track to surpass 1 million sales for the first time ever this year. Those numbers, however, are not meeting the expectations of manufacturers, car dealers and President Biden. ""Major auto companies are preparing for 50% of future sales to be electric vehicles by 2030, 100% by 2035,"" Biden said during remarks on rising prices in June 2022. Now several companies are readjusting their targets and slowing production, even with the rise in vehicles on the road. ""It has a lot to do with electric vehicles, adoption and the segments of the adoption,"" said Kevin Book, managing director of Clearview Energy Partners. ""The first buyers, the early adopters, the one-percenters are only so much of the market. And then there are also the big users, the drivers for whom the sticker price matters less than the fuel price, folks like Uber drivers. For the rest of us, it's asking an awful lot of us to pay more so that we can drive shorter distances and have longer fueling times."" Car dealers are also warning Biden's goal may be too ambitious. More than 3,000 dealerships signed a letter calling on the White House to slow proposed regulations that mandate battery electric vehicle production and distribution. ""While the goals of the regulations are admirable, they require consumer acceptance to become a reality,"" the letter said. ""With each passing day, it becomes more apparent that this attempted electric vehicle mandate is unrealistic based on current and forecasted customer demand. Already, electric vehicles are stacking up on our lots, which is our best indicator of customer demand in the marketplace."" Electric vehicles made up just under 1% of all vehicle registrations in 2022. When looking at registrations over the past five years, the number of EVs on the road has increased significantly. Since 2017, registrations in the U.S. have grown by nearly 547%. ""It's really important to talk about this today because electric vehicles are for certain customers who don't travel long distances, use it more (in a) commuting atmosphere, that are wealthier,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley said on ""Special Report"" in September. ""The F-150 Lightning is the bestselling electric pickup in the U.S. And for those customers, it works great, but it's not for everyone. We're going to offer customers a choice."" Ford has since said it is slowing production of its F-150 Lightning pickup. It’s also pausing construction at a Kentucky battery factory and postponing $12 billion in planned spending on EV production. ""There's a lot of oversupply right now, so consumers have more options,"" Cox Automotive Industry Insights director Stephanie Valdez Streaty said. ""A year ago from today, there's 50 more models that consumers can buy."" Hybrid cars are also adding to the competition to shift away from gas. Registrations have increased over the years and now make up 2% of the vehicle market share. ""It seems very likely that the United States is going to electrify its transportation substantially, but maybe not as soon as hoped,"" Book said. ""There's a lot more of us who care about our turn signals than our virtue signals. General Motors is delaying the release of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Electric pickups by one year. Tesla is also holding off on production at its planned factory in Mexico. Ford F-150 Lightnings ""Enthusiasm has stalled,"" the coalition of car dealers wrote. ""Today, the supply of unsold BEVs (battery electric vehicles) is surging, as they are not selling nearly as fast as they are arriving at our dealerships — even with deep price cuts, manufacturer incentives, and generous government incentives."" The Inflation Reduction Act created a $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit for owners of new electric vehicles. The IRS states on its website that the vehicle must be purchased after April 18, 2023, and must meet critical mineral and battery components to qualify for the credit. ""One big thing which I think we need to continue to do is educate,"" Valdez Streaty said. ""Consumers are confused about the Inflation Reduction Act. What does it mean? What's eligible?"" Some lawmakers have criticized the Biden administration for pushing auto dealers and manufacturers to transition to electric too quickly and without enough incentives to get consumers to bite. ""They were so aggressive on this. They're way, way out over their skis,"" Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said. ""You can't even bribe the public with $7,500. They're not there yet. It's a good product. They'll get there eventually. But I'm not getting rid of my gasoline car anytime soon, I can assure you."" Tesla Model S electric vehicle A Tesla Model S electric car stops for recharging April 9, 2023, at a service station in Greenwich, Conn. (Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images) The credit often doesn’t make up for the price difference between EVs and gas-powered cars. U.S. News and World Report lists Chevy’s Bolt EUV as the most affordable new electric car. Its price tag of $27,800 is still nearly $12,000 more than the most affordable new gas car, the Nissan Versa. ""The price premium still exists in spite of that tax credit,"" Book said. ""So, when you have a higher price for mobility, what you're going to see are really two things — a slower uptake by price sensitive drivers, which I think we're seeing, and also longer retention of existing cars, which means old gas guzzlers staying on the road longer and potentially polluting more."" The federal government also offers a credit of up to $4,000 for used electric cars. There are also some state and local incentives available. ""I think incentives are key, but I also think that the industry will need to continue to build and create models that are in that under $30,000,"" Valdez Streaty said. AAA estimates fuel and maintenance is cheaper for electric vehicle owners. About 15,000 miles worth of electricity costs an average of $546 while gasoline costs around 130% more, over $1,200. Annual maintenance for an EV is estimated to be about $300 less than a gas-powered car. ""Fortunately, the battery prices are going down, and that's a large cost of a vehicle. So, I think that's good news,"" Valdez Streaty said. ""We'll continue to see that over the next few months and into next year.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-report-unmasks-true-costs-electric-vehicle-mandates-remain-expensive,Fox News,right,New report unmasks true costs of electric vehicle mandates: 'Remain more expensive',Thomas Catenacci ,10/25/2023,"A sweeping first-of-its-kind analysis published by think tank Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF) concludes that electric vehicles (EV) would cost tens of thousands of dollars more if not for generous taxpayer-funded incentives. According to the TPPF report — authored by energy experts Jason Isaac and Brent Bennett — the average model year 2021 EV would cost approximately $48,698 more to own over a 10-year period without the staggering $22 billion in taxpayer-funded handouts that the government provides to electric car manufacturers and owners. The analysis factors in federal fuel efficiency programs, electric grid strain, and direct state and federal subsidies. ""It is not an overstatement to say that the federal government is subsidizing EVs to a greater degree than even wind and solar electricity generation and embarking on an unprecedented endeavor to remake the entire American auto industry,"" the report states. ""Despite these massive incentives, EVs are receiving a tepid response from the majority of Americans who cannot shoulder their higher cost."" ""It’s time for federal and state governments to stop driving the American auto industry off an economic cliff and allow markets to drive further improvements in cost and efficiency,"" it continues. President Biden previously set a goal of ensuring 50% of car purchases are electric by 2030. The White House said EPA's recent tailpipe rules would provide a ""clear pathway for a continued rise in EV sales."" The report determined that, thanks to a special multiplier that has existed for more than two decades, EVs receive roughly seven times more credits under federal fuel efficiency programs than they provide in actual fuel economy benefits. That figure, the total regulatory credits from federal and state fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards, amounts to an average of $27,881 per vehicle for EV makers. Further, the analysis calculated the socialized cost of EV charging stations' strain on the U.S. electric grid amounts to an average of $11,833 per EV over 10 years. Such costs are shouldered by utility ratepayers and taxpayers, many of whom may not own an EV. And, finally, state governments and the federal government provide an average of $8,984 per EV over 10 years in direct taxpayer-funded subsidies. ""The stark reality for proponents of EVs and for the dreamers in the federal government, who are using fuel economy regulations to force manufacturers to produce ever more EVs, is that the true cost of an EV is in no way close to a comparable [internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV)],"" the report concludes. ""Without increased and sustained government favors, EVs will remain more expensive than ICEVs for many years to come,"" it states. ""Hence why, even with these subsidies, EVs have been challenging for dealers to sell and why basic economic realities indicate that the Biden administration’s dream of achieving 100% EVs by 2040 will never become a reality."" California Governor Gavin Newsom speaks at a conference The TPPF report, meanwhile, comes as lawmakers at the federal and state level continue to take aim at traditional gas-powered vehicles while boosting EVs. President Biden has set a goal of ensuring 50% of all car sales are zero-emissions by 2030 and his administration has pursued rigorous restrictions on gas-powered vehicles. In December 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized rules, which targeted heavy-duty trucks, that it said at the time were the ""strongest-ever national clean air standards to cut smog- and soot-forming emissions"" from such vehicles. The new standards went into effect on March 27 and will be implemented for new trucks sold after 2027. Then, in April, the EPA proposed the most aggressive federal tailpipe emissions rules on light- and medium-duty emissions ever crafted. If finalized and implemented, 67% of new sedan, crossover, SUV and light truck purchases, up to 50% of bus and garbage truck purchases, 35% of short-haul freight tractor purchases, and 25% of long-haul freight tractor purchases could be electric by 2032, the White House projected. Electric cars lined up in parking lot Months later, in July, the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued its most aggressive fuel economy standards ever, an action critics say would increase consumer costs. And last year, the EPA also reinstated California’s authority under the Clean Air Act to implement its own emission standards and electric vehicle sales mandates, allowing other states to also adopt California's rules. The state then approved regulations that mandated all car purchases in the state — which leads the country in annual car sales — be electric by 2035. ""The Biden administration and leftist states such as California have pushed for widespread electrification in less than 20 years through government subsidies and coercive regulations, but the price you see in the lot is not the true cost of an electric vehicle,"" Isaac, one of the TPPF report's authors, told Fox News Digital. ""Electric vehicle owners have been the beneficiaries of regulatory credits, subsidies, and socialized infrastructure costs totaling nearly 50 thousand dollars per EV,"" he said. ""These costs are borne by gasoline vehicle owners, taxpayers, and utility ratepayers, who are all paying a hefty price for someone else’s EV."""
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-electric-vehicle-strategy-not-silver-bullet-reduce-emissions,Fox News,right,Biden's electric vehicle strategy is not the silver bullet to reduce emissions,Rep. Tim Walberg,11/28/2023,"The Biden administration and the far-left’s Green New Deal agenda is coming for your gas-powered vehicle, but it turns out their laser focus on electric vehicles (EVs) may actually harm the very environment they want to protect. While we recognize the importance of reducing transportation emissions, and vehicle electrification can play its part, we do not share the same optimism expressed by the Biden administration and its proponents on how effective an EV-only strategy can be. When is less consumer choice ever a good thing? The government should not be picking winners and losers when it comes to reducing global emissions. If the administration continues to put all our eggs in the EV basket, it may actually result in higher emissions globally, and while vehicle electrification is an option, it is far from a silver bullet. First, EVs are not a realistic option for the majority of American families. According to recent research from CRES Forum, the average EV owner’s household income is over $100,000, which only equates to about 31% of U.S. households, and supply chain shortages have caused the prices of EVs to continue to rise. Not only are EVs cost-prohibitive, but in areas of extreme cold weather, like Michigan, current battery technologies are inadequate – potentially costing even more – and a lack of electric charging infrastructure puts drivers in rural and underdeveloped areas at risk. The marketplace already reflects consumer unwillingness to purchase EVs. Electric vehicles sit unbought on car dealership lots, and in the last six months, most auto companies have lowered their EV targets or have had to significantly discount their vehicles because of slowing demand. With this downward trend, forcing two-thirds of all new vehicles to be electric in less than 10 years does not make economic sense. Second, manufacturing batteries used in EVs is an endeavor monopolized by our primary adversary: the Chinese Communist Party. Not only do they dominate the supply of 21 of the 50 U.S.-designated critical minerals – many of which are essential for EV battery production – but they also control over 90% of the processing and refining supply chain capacity. This means even American manufacturers are currently reliant on China, which also poses a risk to our national security. To reach the EV target set out by the International Energy Agency’s net-zero emissions plan, global demand for lithium and cobalt far exceeds global reserves – by over 200% and 400%, respectively. While the administration has lamented the need to strengthen our domestic critical mineral supplies, their actions demonstrate the opposite. Biden’s officials continue to block domestic mining projects and kowtow to extreme environmentalists who want to have their cake and eat it too. Last, China’s economy is more than three times more carbon-intensive than the United States, meaning the production of EV battery components potentially outweighs the emission-reducing benefits they eventually provide. To put it plainly, U.S. EV regulations are putting our future in the hands of a hostile regime with very few environmental or labor protections, with little to no reduction in global carbon emissions to show for it. This is unacceptable. The American Dream works because of free market principles and competition. Just as we advocate for an all-of-the-above approach to energy production to strengthen American leadership and the U.S. economy, the same approach should be applied to reducing transportation emissions. During a period of already-crippling inflation, Americans – and the U.S. economy – cannot afford to increase the price of vehicles based solely on ""pie in the sky"" zero-emissions dreams. And because the administration’s approach rewards EV adoption – not emissions mitigation – vehicle options are going down the drain. We should encourage consumer choice instead of tying the hands of America’s car manufacturers and forcing families to purchase electric vehicles that may or may not work for their lifestyle. The Choice in Automobile Sales (CARS) Act prohibits the Biden administration from imposing aggressive and unrealistic emissions standards on American consumers and protects families from mandates that limit the availability of vehicles based on engine type. To lower transportation emissions, we should encourage American leadership and innovation. We should explore emission-reducing alternatives, including but not limited to, increased numbers of hybrid vehicles, higher mile-per-gallon engines, and expanded fuel sources like renewable natural gas. Why would we take these options off the table? By rewarding all emission reduction efforts rather than just EV purchases, we would be encouraging carbon removal and sequestration throughout the fuel production process. It would also ensure trade policies focus on life cycle emissions so we can actually achieve our goal of reducing global emissions – not just political priorities. The bottom line: Electrification is not the silver bullet for reducing transportation emissions. Without greatly expanding our electric infrastructure and bolstering our domestic critical mineral supplies, an EV-only approach will do more to harm the environment than it will to help it, at the expense of consumer choice. We will continue to advocate for American consumers, who deserve low-cost solutions, and for U.S. global leadership, so we can lower transportation emissions, strengthen the U.S. economy, and leave the planet better than we found it."
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/californias-grid-faces-collapse-leaders-push-renewables-electric-vehicles-experts-say,Fox News,right,"California's grid faces collapse as leaders push renewables, electric vehicles, experts say",Thomas Catenacci ,2/14/2023,"California's electric grid faces years of potential blackouts and failure as state leaders continue pushing aggressive measures to transition to renewable energy sources, policy experts tell Fox News Digital. The state's grid, which is still mainly powered by fossil fuels, is undergoing a major shift from natural gas and coal power to renewable power like wind and solar. Simultaneously, state officials are pushing an electrification of the economy, particularly in the transportation sector through electric vehicle mandates, which is expected to increase pressure on the grid. ""California is drastically cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and cleaning our air,"" Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a November announcement unveiling the ""world’s first detailed pathway to carbon neutrality."" The state's plan involves goals to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 85%, cut oil usage by 94% and deploy more solar and wind capacity over the next two decades. The aggressive plan to overhaul the state's energy system came three months after a top California environmental agency moved forward with a rule requiring all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2035. In 2021, the most recent year with data, wind and solar accounted for about 25% of total electricity generated in California while natural gas accounted for more than 50% of in-state electricity generation. And 19% of new car sales in California were zero-emission vehicles, state data showed. Experts told Fox News Digital environmental mandates implemented by Newsom and his administration have already created instability in the grid, an issue they argued would only get worse as existing fossil fuel power generation capacity was taken offline and replaced by intermittent sources. ""They're going to have to build an outrageous amount of wind and solar in a very short time if they want to accomplish their objectives of electrifying — our whole transportation sector and our whole home heating and cooling and residential sector,"" Edward Ring, a senior fellow with and co-founder of the California Policy Center, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""There's a burden to the consumer that's going to get very heavy,"" he continued. ""Even if they can pull it off without blackouts, the burden to the consumer is going to be ridiculous."" Over summer, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), the state's electric grid operator, repeatedly warned that high demand would significantly strain utility providers' ability to supply consumers electricity amid a heat wave. CAISO issued an ""energy emergency alert 3,"" its highest alert level, at one point in early September, saying residents should maximize conservation and expect rotating outages, and a flex alert for more than seven consecutive days. The operator also recommended residents refrain from charging electric vehicles to reduce stress on the grid. Wind turbines in California ""They already are suffering,"" said Myron Ebell, the director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute's Center for Energy and Environment. ""They're, in fact, telling people that they're going to start shutting off natural gas to houses and that they have to convert to electricity,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Then, they're forcing people to buy electric vehicles and they're going to stop selling internal combustion engine vehicles. That will add to the grid's demand."" In its annual report released in December, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), a nonpartisan grid watchdog, stated that California faced a ""high risk of energy or capacity shortfall"" in coming years, particularly during summer months, as a result of traditional power plant retirements and increased demand. Ebell added that the intermittent nature of solar and wind, meaning they produce less power relative to their total generation capacity, could create instability. Green energy developers and government officials often highlight total capacity of new renewable power projects, but fail to mention how much actual power the project is expected to produce. Solar panels, for example, produce just 25% and wind turbines produce 34% of their listed capacity, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Coal, natural gas and nuclear power plants, meanwhile produce 49%, 54% and 93% of their listed capacity, respectively. solar panels california ""The only way the electrification of the transportation sector and of home heating and cooling can work is if the utility sector continues to build natural gas fired plants and looks to building nuclear plants and perhaps building new coal plants because the grid in these states that are pushing these policies is already overloaded,"" Ebell continued. ""As everybody moves to EVs, if it happens, the only way to do it is to find more baseload power and dispatchable power."" The total capacity of the state's natural gas power plants has fallen 15% between 2013 and 2021, according to the California Energy Commission. In April, Newsom was forced to reverse course on plans to allow California's only remaining nuclear plant, which alone produces 9% of the state's electricity generation, to close. California also imports more electricity than any other state in the U.S., receiving between 20%-30% of its supplies from mainly fossil fuels out-of-state, EIA data shows. Another potential hurdle to the future of California's grid stability is the need for new transmission line infrastructure to handle additional demand and connect new renewable energy projects, often located in rural regions, to the grid, Steven Malanga, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, told Fox News Digital. He also argued leaders should put greater emphasis on battery storage which remains far behind where it needs to be. ""These are tremendous costs which haven't been fairly calculated by the renewable energy people,"" Malanga said in an interview. ""Essentially what happens is we have this power grid that has been built up over the decades and to go renewable doesn't just involve building renewable like wind farms and solar farms, but you also have to build new transmission lines."" ""And more significantly, you have to build storage capacity,"" he continued. ""In a lot of places like California, they're not even backing up renewables with natural gas, which is really what most sensible people, utility people, say you have to do because renewables are intermittent."" The Department of Energy estimated last year that the U.S. would need to expand its transmission infrastructure 60% by 2030 and triple its size by 2050 to meet climate goals. According to an independent analysis by energy researcher Robert Bryce, at its current pace, it would take an estimated 282 years to triple the nation's transmission capacity. Like other energy projects and infrastructure development, transmission lines often face delays from environmental regulation and local opposition. ""You have to get that power to cities which are the big users of electricity,"" Malanga told Fox News Digital. ""So, you have to build all new transmission lines. Transmission lines are not only expensive to build, but they face tremendous environmental regulations. Permitting them takes years."" ""It takes ten years just to get approvals to build some of these transmission lines and that's just one generation,"" he added. ""Some of these places have renewable targets that are 2035, 2040 and 2045. That's not that's far in the future if you're talking about building a whole new energy infrastructure, which is essentially what we're talking about in California."" ""The truth of the matter is that in many places we've seen how the energy grid is already dangerously close to failing because we're not paying enough attention to sustaining the grid. This is going to result in blackouts. And we've already seen them. The stories are tragic."""
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/oversight-republicans-warn-bidens-electric-vehicle-push-will-benefit-china-hurt-american-jobs,Fox News,right,Oversight Republicans warn Biden's electric vehicle push will benefit China and hurt American jobs,Kelly Laco,8/24/2022," House Oversight Committee Republicans are warning that the Biden administration's push for electric vehicles will benefit Chinese technology companies and hurt American jobs. In a letter to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the 16 lawmakers led by committee Ranking Member Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., write that they are examining ""the false claims"" made by the Biden administration regarding the impact of electric cars on U.S. jobs. ""As the Secretary for the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and an advocate for Americans’ widespread adoption of EVs [electric vehicles], your agency is in a position to explain how Ford’s actions help American workers and the economy,"" they write in the letter, first obtained by Fox News Digital. Biden set a goal of having electric vehicles make up half of all vehicle sales in America by 2030, and the Department of Energy announced in May more than $3 billion in funding to bolster supply chains and expand domestic production of advanced batteries in an effort to meet that goal. As a result, according to reports, Ford Motor Co. is planning to cut as many as 8,000 jobs as the company looks to make its way in the electric car market. The company also announced that it will obtain electric vehicle batteries from a Chinese company--Contemporary Amperex Technology Company Limited (CATL). In a letter to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the 16 lawmakers led by committee Ranking Member Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., write that they are examining ""the false claims"" made by the Biden administration regarding the impact of electric cars on U.S. jobs. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images/Poo) ""CATL alone ‘holds one-third of the global electric-car-battery market.’ This raises concerns about whether the push for EVs over gas-fueled vehicles will make America even more reliant on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) instead of American energy resources,"" the lawmakers write. They call the reliance of American manufacturers on CATL ""particularly troubling"" because the company is ""influential in the Chinese government."" The Republicans write: ""CATL is considering two factories in Mexico to produce batteries for Ford and other vehicle manufacturers. It is troubling that the Administration-endorsed EV future is already eliminating American jobs while benefiting China."" In addition, the lawmakers question the Biden administration's ""mixed messages"" regarding energy policies – blaming companies for ""both producing too much oil and not enough. Pete Buttigieg is in a feud with Marco Rubio ""You are a vocal supporter of a shift towards EVs and encourage Americans to make the change. In testimony before the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, you stated the rise of domestic clean energy production is 'creating a lot of jobs.' However, the actions taken by Ford confirm the opposite is true, and the people benefiting most from the Biden Administration’s push for EVs are not Americans but our foreign adversaries,"" the letter states. The lawmakers ask for a briefing by the secretary before Aug. 31 to address the loss of American jobs and the benefit to China. During a recent House hearing, Buttigieg told Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., that ""the more pain we are all experiencing from the high price of gas, the more benefit there is for those who can access electric vehicle."" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm However, critics have said this shows how little regard the Biden administration has for the working class. ""We're for cutting the costs of electric vehicles -- because when you have an electric vehicle, then you're also going to be able to save on gas, but you’ve got to be able to afford it in the first place,"" Buttigieg explained to Big Boy's Neighborhood radio show in Los Angeles in a July interview. A spokesperson for Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told Fox News Digital previously that the secretary ""has always made clear the Administration’s efforts to make electric vehicles cheaper to purchase so that more Americans can have access to the economic and climate benefits that EVs offer."" A spokesperson for the Department of Transportation told Fox News Digital the agency looks to reviewing the letter, and it is their policy to respond directly to committees."
https://www.foxnews.com/auto/ford-ceo-farley-says-these-customers-arent-ready-for-electric-cars,Fox News,right,Ford CEO Farley says these customers aren't ready for electric cars,Gary Gastelu ,12/7/2021,"Ford is going electric, but not yet all-electric. The automaker plans to be building 600,000 EVs annually by 2025 and have 40% of its new vehicles fully battery-powered by 2030, but hasn't yet put a date on when that number will be 100%. The F-150 Lightning is the first all-electric version of the full size truck. (Ford) Ford CEO Jim Farley explained to Automotive News that not all of its customers are ready to make the transition, due to their specific needs. ""We have a lot of rural customers at Ford that a lot of other brands don't have. We have Super Duty customers who do heavy-duty towing: horse trailers, people in the energy business who are towing big-time loads over very long distances. It's hard for me to imagine that all those customers will go electric in the next 10 years,"" Farley said. ""They're actually as interested in the technology as anyone, it's just their use case is different than how we've designed the vehicles so far. It does feel, at least for Ford, the transition's happening faster than we thought. But again, it's the first inning of a maybe nine-inning game."" Ford will be launching the all-electric F-150 Lightning in 2022, which has a maximum towing capacity of 10,000 pounds and a range of up to 300 miles, but has not announced any plans to introduce an electric Super Duty EV. Farley said the company has nearly 200,000 reservations for the F-150 Lightning and that its next-generation full-size electric pickup will be built in high volumes at its new Blue Oval City factory in Tennessee. Unlike GM, which has said it will go all-electric in the U.S. by 2035, Ford sees hybrids playing a role in its lineup for years to come. This sentiment is shared by Toyota, due in part to the difficulties of electric car ownership for urban customers with limited access to charging stations as the infrastructure is built-out. Ford this month will start deliveries of its Maverick Hybrid compact pickup, which has an EPA rating of 37 miles per gallon combined."
https://www.foxnews.com/auto/electric-vehicles-far-advertised-report,Fox News,right,"Many electric vehicles can't go as far as advertised, report says",Gary Gastelu ,5/1/2023,"A new look at the driving range ratings for electric cars has found that many of them come up short. SAE International (formerly known as the Society of Automotive Engineers) and Car and Driver collaborated on the study, which compares real-world testing with the EPA-certified figures listed on the window stickers. Internal combustion engine models display fuel economy figures for city, highway and combined estimates, while electric vehicles only get a combined rating. Both are also given a total range rating representing how far they are expected to drive on a full tank or battery charge, which is based on the expectations that 55% of the driving takes place in the city. Electric and hybrid vehicles tend to be more efficient in city driving because they can use their motors as brakes that recapture energy, which charges the battery during stop-and-go driving. It's the opposite for internal combustion engine vehicles, which are typically more efficient when traveling at a constant speed. In 2016, Car and Driver intimated its own real-world highway test for all vehicles, which is conducted over about 200 miles at 75 mph. window sticker A look at the figures found that internal combustion engine models outperformed their ratings by 4% on average, while electric vehicles fell short by 12.5% ""Basically we've taken a look at how vehicles perform relative to the values on the window sticker, looking at the difference between what the label says and what we actually see in our real-world highway test,"" explained Car and Driver testing director Dave VanderWerp. ""We see a big difference in that gap between gas-powered vehicles and the performance of EVs."" corvette window For an electric vehicle with a listed range of 300 miles, the 12.5% drop would mean it could only go 262.5 miles between charges in perfect conditions, not taking into account the negative effect extreme temperatures have on battery performance. But the way the cars are rated by the EPA makes the issue even more confusing. The tests are conducted across several speeds, often by the automakers themselves, and multipliers are used to come up with the final number. Tesla Model S The Tesla Model S is available in a version rated at 396 miles per charge. (Tesla) There are two different testing cycles available, one of which tends to produce higher numbers, and the automakers can choose which one to use for certification. European automakers often go with the more pessimistic option, which results in lower, but more accurate figures. ""400 miles of stated range for a Tesla and 300 miles for a Porsche is pretty much the same number at real highway speeds,"" VanderWerp said. The study suggests that the certification process should be updated with new calculations that better reflect what consumers can expect and that all electric vehicles use the same testing criteria. "

JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO: Here’s what I think: When Joe Biden came out and told the mom-and-pop gas stations to lower the prices, they all got scared of Joe and thought we better lower the price of gas. That is all hogwash. What this guy is doing now is taking credit for something he didn’t do. And now he declares this emergency, everybody’s going to say oh, my gosh, what are we going to do, there’s not going to be any gas even though he is taking credit for more gas, they’ve now got to buy an electric vehicle and the average one costs $64,000. The average car costs $46,000. The average American doesn’t have a new car. So the average American, and when Pete Buttigieg says, you may pay a little more on your car payment, the average American doesn’t have a car payment. The average American is driving a car that he or she has had for a long time, and they are not making payments. The car is paid for, it’s old, they are just surviving and deciding if they have enough gas to go to work and to buy the food they need and the sad part of all of this is that they don’t understand America. They don’t understand what is going on in America. They just say buy an electric vehicle or the government should get electric vehicles. We don’t have the infrastructure for electric vehicles. And I’m not going to tell you who it is, but the guy that I buy some of my cars from, he says to me, I am buying one, I don’t even like it. I don’t want to drive it. I can’t drive it anywhere but around town. Let me finish. This is all make-believe nonsense where America is not supporting these green lunatics!"

Roberts said officials like Department of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm have ""toned down"" their discourse in those regards after ""getting burned"" by a populace feeling the effects of a faltering economy – but added their comments still show little regard for the working class. During a recent House hearing, Buttigieg told Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., that ""the more pain we are all experiencing from the high price of gas, the more benefit there is for those who can access electric vehicle."" Gimenez responded by asking if that meant the ""more pain we have, the more benefit,"" to which Buttigieg replied the Miami lawmaker only ""wanted"" him to say it that way. Last year, Granholm guffawed at a Bloomberg anchor's question regarding plans to lower oil prices: ""That is hilarious, would that (sic) if I had the magic wand,"" she said, adding in March the Russian invasion of Ukraine presented the U.S. with an opportunity to ""act on clean energy."" Roberts criticized such instances, saying the administration still appears fully vested in a rapid green energy conversion. ""Unfortunately, I've not seen any change in tact,"" Roberts told Fox News Digital. ""In other words, all the plans that we see coming down the pike; that is, rules and proposed rules and regulations, reflect the condescending rhetoric of these cabinet secretaries,"" Pete Buttigieg is in a feud with Marco Rubio USDOT Secretary Pete Buttigieg speaks as Labor Secretary Martin Walsh listens. (AP/Susan Walsh, File) ""I have not heard, since then, either of those secretaries … using that same kind of condescending language, because thankfully they got burned for saying it."" Roberts also compared support for a transition from fossil fuels to the global Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) agenda, saying the same type of working class people suffering abroad under ESG governance are the ones in America also feeling the pinch from high oil prices and the like. ""I just thought it was very telling about the real key repercussion of ESG if it's fully implemented – and it is that the working-class American – who [isn't] living just paycheck to paycheck and have just a little bit better situation than that,"" Roberts said. ""These are the people those kinds of comments really offend."" Roberts suggested the push for curbing U.S. fossil fuel use in favor of green alternatives is not geared toward benefiting the average American, but instead Beltway insiders and their aligned academics who seek ideological ends. Such ideas ""come from people who live in the ivory tower of D.C. who think that they're in some sort of policy fantasyland,"" he said. In response to Robert's comments, a spokesperson for Buttigieg pointed to the secretary's July interview with the Big Boy's Neighborhood radio show in Los Angeles, when he said the Biden administration has indeed taken steps to make flex-fuel ethanol blends more accessible for gas-powered vehicles and supported a federal gas tax holiday for short-term relief, while explaining longer-term solutions: ""We're for cutting the costs of electric vehicles -- because when you have an electric vehicle, then you're also going to be able to save on gas, but you’ve got to be able to afford it in the first place,"" Buttigieg told Big Boy. Dr. Kevin Roberts serves as the seventh president in Heritage’s 48-year history. (Heritage Foundation) ""Now, we’re actually starting to see on some models the costs come to where even if your car payment is a little higher, your gas payment will be a little lower, and you come out ahead. But the prices still need to come down for most Americans to get an EV -- We could do that with legislation in Congress,"" said Buttigieg. The Transportation Department spokesperson cited figures in a June Consumer Reports analysis reflecting points of Buttigieg's testimony in the House Transportation and Infrastructure hearing in which he sparred with Gimenez, reflecting a price drop for EV car models such as the Chevrolet Bolt, then quoted at around $27,000 new. A spokesperson for Granholm responded that the secretary ""has always made clear the Administration’s efforts to make electric vehicles cheaper to purchase so that more Americans can have access to the economic and climate benefits that EVs offer."" In response to the Bloomberg interview, the spokesperson said Granholm does not dictate actions of the oil and gas industry, adding the question posed by the anchor failed to understand Granholm's role in the government. ""As the administration’s methodical releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve have contributed to lowering gas prices by 40 [cents per gallon] Secretary Granholm continues to call on the oil and gas industry to do their part in ensuring Americans have a reliable sources of energy,"" the spokesperson told Fox News Digital. In his interview with Fox News Digital, Roberts also reacted to Biden's recent Saudi Arabia trip, where he made a heavily-criticized fist-bump with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Roberts said the move was ill-advised and misdirected. ""It was the fist-bump from hell,"" Roberts said. ""And what I mean by that is, not to criticize any president who's traveling the world, I think we need our president, whoever he is making sure that American interests are reflected abroad – the problem is, it was groveling to an autocrat."" If Biden wants to give fist-bumps to encourage increased energy production, Roberts added, he should go to Texas, Pennsylvania or Alaska and greet the thousands of oil and gas workers there in kind. ""[They] would love their companies to be drilling more and exploring more,"" he said, as the president has restricted speculation on federal lands and canceled domestic pipeline projects. The U.S. energy workers know best it is possible for America to power itself via our vast reserves, Roberts added, pointing to Trump-era output creating virtual self-reliance: ""[A]s we witnessed just three years ago, America can be self-sustaining with energy. We don't need to go around the world groveling to autocrats like the leader of Saudi Arabia,"" he said. ""And certainly, we don't need photo-ops like a fist bump when it's the American worker who needs it."""
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-rejects-ted-cruzs-bill-defund-biden-official-leading-electric-vehicle-push,Fox News,right,Senate rejects Ted Cruz's bill to defund Biden official leading electric vehicle push,Thomas Catenacci ,8/31/2023," ‘The Five’ co-hosts discuss how Democrats are stoking climate anxiety and the climate pushback from Bill Gates. The Senate rejected a bill introduced last month by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., that proposed to strip the salary from a Biden administration official overseeing federal fuel efficiency regulations. The GOP bill — which was introduced on Sept. 29 as an amendment to a fiscal year 2024 appropriations package — failed in a 49-47 floor vote Tuesday in which Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., joined Cruz, Lummis and 44 other Republicans who voted in favor. If it had passed, the bill would have stripped the salary of Ann Carlson, the acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a Transportation Department subagency. ""It’s disappointing but unsurprising Senate Democrats were keener on keeping in place an ethically-challenged, environmental zealot who wants to ban gas cars than protecting the Senate’s constitutional authority on presidential nominations,"" Cruz said in a statement after the floor vote. ""With this vote, the Biden administration will continue violating the Vacancies Act and crusading against traditional American energy,"" the Texas Republican continued. Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee led by Cruz, who is the panel's ranking member, have argued the White House is skirting constitutional requirements by allowing Carlson to lead NHTSA in an ""acting"" capacity. Earlier this year, after substantial industry and congressional opposition over her past environmental activism, Carlson failed to clear Senate confirmation to permanently lead NHTSA. Carlson, though, remains NHTSA's acting administrator despite failing to be confirmed by the Senate. Because the White House withdrew her nomination before she received a floor vote, she is technically allowed to be paid as NHTSA's acting administrator since she wasn't directly rejected, a loophole Cruz's bill aimed to close. And while serving as the agency's acting administrator, Carlson helped craft NHTSA's most-aggressive-ever fuel economy standards in July. Experts warned the regulations would substantially increase car prices and force electric vehicle purchases, but Carlson said they would ""reduce harmful emissions."" ""Ann Carlson is an exceptionally capable and dedicated public servant who remains laser focused on safety and is undeterred by partisan attacks that attempt to distract from the agency’s lifesaving work,"" a Transportation Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital prior to the vote Tuesday. ""Under her leadership, NHTSA has issued recalls affecting nearly 70 million vehicles in the United States, finalized 18 rules, and seen roadway deaths decline five consecutive quarters. Her service has helped advance NHTSA’s mission to save lives and reduce the economic costs of roadway crashes,"" the spokesperson added. Ahead of the vote on Cruz and Lummis' bill Tuesday, Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said, if approved, the bill would set a dangerous precedent moving forward. He noted that multiple officials served lengthy tenures during the Trump administration in an acting capacity. ""It is fine for you to disagree with fuel efficiency standards. It is fine for you to never want to move on from the internal combustion engine and to oppose the electric vehicle revolution. That's fine,"" Schatz remarked on the Senate floor. ""What is not okay is the United States Senate coming in and defunding a position of an administrator with whom you disagree."" In addition, over the weekend, Republican Commerce Committee staff circulated a memo first obtained by Fox News Digital which highlighted the panel's findings from an ethics investigation the panel opened into Carlson. EV charging station According to the memo, while she was an environmental law professor at UCLA, Carlson was actively involved in and helped coordinate California law firm Sher Edling's efforts to pursue novel litigation against fossil fuel companies. In recent years, Sher Edling has filed more than a dozen so-called climate nuisance lawsuits on behalf of cities, counties and several states, arguing the oil industry has been aware of climate change impacts for decades. Fox News Digital previously reported that Carlson worked with Dan Emmett, the chairman of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change & the Environment to raise money from liberal non-profit organizations to fund Sher Edling's work through an indirect dark money fund. The pair secured support from Terry Tamminen in his role as the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation's CEO at the time. According to tax filings, between 2017 and 2020, the secretive Collective Action Fund for Accountability, Resilience, and Adaptation (CAF) wired more than $5.2 million to Sher Edling. Then, in 2021 alone, CAF funneled another $3 million to the firm. Carlson also reported in financial disclosures that she provided pro bono consulting for Sher Edling on its litigation against oil companies."
https://www.dailywire.com/news/cost-of-driving-electric-vehicle-equal-to-paying-17-33-per-gallon-of-gasoline-study-finds,Daily Wire,right,Study: 'True Costs' of Electric Vehicles Far Higher Than Most Believe,Hank Berrien,10/27/2023,"A comprehensive new study of electric vehicles found that the total cost of running them, when government subsidies are factored in, is significantly higher than commonly believed. Brent Bennett and Jason Isaac issued their report for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, pointing out that advocates for electric vehicles claim the vehicles require lower maintenance and lower fueling costs than traditional vehicles, and future reductions in battery prices will make EVs less expensive. But, they argue, “no one has attempted to calculate the full financial benefit of the wide array of direct subsidies, regulatory credits, and subsidized infrastructure that contribute to the economic viability of EVs.” They give evidence that “the average model year (MY) 2021 EV would cost $48,698 more to own over a 10-year period without $22 billion in government favors given to EV manufacturers and owners. … Adding the costs of the subsidies to the true cost of fueling an EV would equate to an EV owner paying $17.33 per gallon of gasoline. And these estimates do not include the hundreds of billions more in subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) for various aspects of the EV supply chain, particularly for battery manufacturing.” “Nearly $22 billion in federal and state subsidies and regulatory credits suppressed the retail price of EVs in 2021 by an average of almost $50,000,” the authors note. “Car lots are swelling with unsold EVs and the Ford Motor Company is losing over $70,000 on each EV it currently sells.” “When we pay for a gallon of gasoline, we are paying for the entire infrastructure to refine, transport, and market that gasoline,” they point out. “When an EV owner connects to the electric grid, how much are they paying for the extra generation, transmission, and distribution costs that they are imposing on the grid, and will those embedded costs rise over time?” They conclude: “The stark reality for proponents of EVs and for the dreamers in the federal government, who are using fuel economy regulations to force manufacturers to produce ever more EVs, is that the true cost of an EV is in no way close to a comparable ICEV [internal combustion engine vehicle]. Our conservative estimate is that the average EV accrues $48,698 in subsidies and $4,569 in extra charging and electricity costs over a 10-year period, for a total cost of $53,267, or $16.12 per equivalent gallon of gasoline. Without increased and sustained government favors, EVs will remain more expensive than ICEVs for many years to come.” "
https://www.dailywire.com/news/ford-loses-billions-on-electric-cars-embraces-hybrids,Daily Wire,right,"Ford Loses Billions On Electric Cars, Embraces Hybrids",Mairead Elordi,7/31/2023,"Ford Motor Company expects to lose a whopping $4.5 billion from its electric vehicles (EVs) this year, the company said in its second-quarter earnings report released Thursday. The Michigan-based automaker said its all-electric vehicle division, called “Ford Model e,” has already lost more than $2.8 billion in the first two quarters of this year, including $1.8 billion in the second quarter alone or about $32,000 for every EV Ford has sold. Ford said the loss reflects the “pricing environment, disciplined investments in new products and capacity, and other costs.” The car company struggled to compete with Tesla, which lowered prices for its electric models earlier this year. Back in March, Ford expected to lose only about $3 billion from electric vehicles this year, but the company bumped that projection up to $4.5 billion last week. The disappointing numbers come after Ford made a big push for electric vehicles last year. The carmaker said it would ramp up its electric vehicle production to 600,000 cars a year by the end of this year. Now, Ford says it will hit that goal next year instead. In the meantime, Ford executives say the company is working on several new hybrid model cars, which can operate in either electric mode or gas mode. “You’re going to see a lot more hybrid systems from us,” CEO Jim Farley said Thursday after the company’s earnings report was released. “What the customer really likes is when we take a hybrid system that’s more efficient for certain duty cycles and then we add new capabilities because of the batteries,” Farley said. Farley said Ford has been “surprised, frankly” at the popularity of the hybrid model for the F-150 pickup truck. More than 10% of Ford buyers who purchased the pickup truck bought the hybrid model, he said. Also, more than half, 56% of Ford customers who bought Ford’s Maverick pickup truck bought the hybrid version. “We’re seeing a lot of customers like that combination of using the batteries for something beyond just moving the vehicle,” Farley said. “And so we’re just listening to the market.” Some of Ford’s hybrids allow users to plug power tools into the car’s battery or plug in a refrigerator for a tailgate party. Ford is still moving forward with its plans for electric cars, but may take quite a while for the company to start profiting from them. Ford sold only 34,000 electric vehicles and hybrids combined in the second quarter of this year, and only 61,575 electric vehicles in the U.S. in all of last year. Some experts say it takes about 100,000 cars sold to even start turning a profit on a new model. However, the company also touted that its electric vehicle revenue is up 39% and that Ford maintains low prices for electric cars, “further establishing leadership ahead of [the] industry’s next-generation EVs.” Ford still turns a massive profit thanks to other sectors of the company, raking in $45 billion in the second quarter with a net income of $1.9 billion. The automobile industry as a whole has raced to adapt ahead of potential government regulations that would require them to produce more electric cars, with car companies spending tens of billions of dollars to develop electric models. In April, the Biden administration’s Environmental Protection Agency proposed a requirement that would cut emissions by 56% and result in 67% of new vehicles being electric by 2032. The Department of Energy has also proposed regulations that would push car makers towards electric vehicles, rejecting criticism from some car makers that the rules could cost the auto industry hundreds of billions of dollars in penalties by 2031."
https://www.dailywire.com/news/only-20-of-americans-very-likely-to-buy-electric-for-their-next-car-even-as-some-states-want-100-adoption,Daily Wire,right,Only 20% of Americans 'Very Likely' To Buy Electric For Their Next Car Even As Some States Want 100% Adoption,Ben Zeisloft,4/11/2023,"Some 19% of Americans indicate that they are “extremely likely” or “very likely” to purchase an electric vehicle for their next car, even as multiple states attempt to transition toward 100% adoption of the vehicles for new car purchases within the next decade. The plurality of respondents to a poll from the Associated Press and the National Opinion Research Center said they were “not too likely” or “not at all likely” to buy an electric vehicle, while another 22% indicated they were “somewhat likely” to buy electric and 12% said they “do not expect to purchase a vehicle.” Dominant reasons for hesitance toward electric cars were prohibitively high costs, a lack of charging stations, and personal preference for gas vehicles, as well as concerns with charging times and lack of confidence in current battery technology. Those who were open to purchasing electric cars meanwhile cited savings on fuel, tax breaks, lessened climate impact, and reduced costs for vehicle maintenance. The poll was conducted between between Jan. 31-Feb. 15 and had 5,400 respondents. It had a 1.7% margin of error. “While there is plenty of interest in purchasing an electric vehicle, the high upfront cost of owning one and concerns about the country’s charging infrastructure are barriers to more people driving them,” AP-NORC Center Deputy Director Jennifer Benz said in a statement. “Policies that alleviate these concerns will be a key component of building support.” The concerns regarding electric vehicles could present obstacles to the multiple states which are attempting to encourage universal adoption of the nascent technology within the next several years. California Air Resources Board officials issued new rules last year requiring 35% of new vehicles to be zero-emission by 2026, a standard that will rise to a 68% benchmark by 2030 and a 100% benchmark by 2035. States such as Massachusetts, Washington, and Virginia have previously passed laws conforming their states to the standards. Researchers have meanwhile noted that the power grids in California and other states are not presently equipped to handle the increased demand arising from widespread electric vehicle ownership. California officials indeed asked residents to refrain from charging their electric cars last summer amid a heat wave that threatened to overwhelm the grid. Additional rules from the California Air Resources Board will require heavy duty truck manufacturers to enact increasingly strict standards aimed to promote electric vehicles such that 100% of new truck sales are zero-emission by 2045. The United States Environmental Protection Agency granted two waivers of federal standards last month so that the state can enforce the requirements. “This is a big deal for climate action. Last year, California became one of the first jurisdictions in the world with a real plan to end tailpipe emissions for cars,” California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement. “Thanks to the Biden administration, we’re getting more zero-emission heavy duty trucks on the roads, expanding our world-leading efforts to cut air pollution and protect public health. We’re leading the charge to get dirty trucks and buses, the most polluting vehicles, off our streets, and other states and countries are lining up to follow our lead around the world.” President Joe Biden has approved a number of laws encouraging a nationwide shift toward renewable power, thereby creating various incentives for electric vehicle ownership. Individuals who purchase certain electric cars can receive tax credits between $4,000 and $7,500 under the Inflation Reduction Act."
https://www.dailywire.com/news/u-s-investigating-nearly-40k-evs-over-reports-of-power-loss-while-driving,Daily Wire,right,U.S. Investigating Nearly 40K Evs Over Reports Of Power Loss While Driving,Zach Jewell,6/19/2023,"U.S. regulators have launched an investigation affecting nearly 40,000 Hyundai Ioniq 5 electric cars after reports of the EVs losing power while on the road. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched an investigation into the 2022 Ioniq 5 after receiving 30 consumer complaints that described a loss of acceleration, Reuters reported. Drivers reported hearing a loud popping noise and then seeing a warning message on the dashboard before the car’s acceleration began to fail, with some saying the car lost all power. The NHTSA said that an initial review from Hyundai indicated that a power surge was damaging transistors and preventing the Ioniqs’ 12-volt batteries from recharging, according to the Associated Press. A Hyundai spokesperson said the company was fully cooperating with the NHTSA investigation and launching a service campaign to update the vehicles’ software and replace a component called the Integrated Control Charging Unit if necessary. The NHTSA estimates that the investigation could affect 39,500 Ioniqs on U.S. roads. In one complaint, a driver reported traveling 75 mph on a highway when “the car became completely unresponsive.” The consumer said there was a semi-truck behind him and one to his right in the slow lane. “The car stopped accelerating, and I was unable to resume driving,” the driver said. “I was forced to coast to a stop on the side of the highway.” Another driver reported hearing a loud pop and “within a few seconds my car lost speed rapidly, from 55 mph to 25 then a second later 22 mph.” There were no reports of the alleged power loss resulting in crashes. Hyundai is not alone in dealing with issues in some of its EVs. Since 2020, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, and Volkswagen have also issued recalls largely due to battery failures that can increase the risk of fires, the AP reported. Tesla vehicles have also been investigated by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which said that their ion-lithium batteries pose a risk to first responders after crashes. The Biden administration has strongly advocated for electric vehicles and is currently seeking a radical shift from gas-powered to EVs within the next decade. In April, Biden proposed a plan seeking to ensure that 67% of all commercial passenger vehicles sold in the U.S. will be all-electric starting in 2032. As the federal government signals it will continue with heavy regulations on the industry, car manufacturers have recently pushed to produce more EVs, but for some manufacturers, that push has initially resulted in massive losses. Earlier this year, Ford projected it would lose $3 billion in 2023 as it pushes to produce more EVs and build electric battery plants in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Michigan."
https://www.dailywire.com/news/california-asks-residents-to-avoid-charging-electric-vehicles-due-to-blackout-risk-days-after-unveiling-new-gas-car-ban,Daily Wire,right,California Asks Residents To Avoid Charging Electric Vehicles Due To Blackout Risk Days After Unveiling New Gas Car Ban,Ben Zeisloft,8/31/2022,"Days ago, officials in California unveiled a plan to phase out new gas-powered cars. Now, officials are asking residents to avoid charging their electric vehicles in the interest of not overwhelming the power grid. The western United States is facing a likely “prolonged and record heat wave” that could lead to temperatures as high as 115 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Weather Service. As a result, the California Independent System Operator is seeking to bring all available resources online to handle higher electricity demand and expects to issue “voluntary energy conservation” notices over the Labor Day weekend. “The top three conservation actions are to set thermostats to 78 degrees or higher, avoid using large appliances and charging electric vehicles, and turn off unnecessary lights,” according to the American Public Power Association. During a “Flex Alert,” residents are encouraged to reduce energy consumption from 4:00 pm to 9:00 pm — the hours in which “demand for electricity remains high and there is less solar energy available.” California also experienced a round of blackouts during last year’s Labor Day weekend. The state issued Flex Alerts because grid operators predicted “an increase in electricity demand, primarily from air conditioning use” related to extreme temperatures. The warnings of low grid capacity come days after the California Air Resources Board issued new rules requiring 35% of new vehicles to produce zero emissions by 2026 — a standard that will rise to a 68% benchmark by 2030 and a 100% level by 2035. Yet experts have warned that the state’s electric grid will require significant upgrades to manage a rapid transition away from internal combustion vehicles. “Today, most people charge their electric cars when they come home in the evening — when electricity demand is typically at its peak,” according to researchers at Cornell University’s College of Engineering. “If left unmanaged, the power demanded from many electric vehicles charging simultaneously in the evening will amplify existing peak loads, potentially outstripping the grid’s current capacity to meet demand.” The legislatures of Massachusetts, Washington, and Virginia have previously passed laws conforming their states to standards approved by the California Air Resources Board. However, officials in Virginia have denounced the state’s laws — greenlit last year when Democrats controlled the General Assembly — and are seeking to repeal them. “In an effort to turn Virginia into California, liberal politicians who previously ran our government sold Virginia out by subjecting Virginia drivers to California vehicle laws,” Governor Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) wrote. “Now, under that pact, Virginians will be forced to adopt the California law that prohibits the sale of gas and diesel-fueled vehicles. I am already at work to prevent this ridiculous edict from being forced on Virginians. California’s out of touch laws have no place in our Commonwealth.” On a national level, Democratic officials have been similarly eager to phase out internal combustion vehicles while incentivizing the purchase of electric cars. The Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed earlier this month, greenlit $7,500 tax credits for the purchase of new electric vehicles — even as Ford and GM raised their electric vehicle prices by approximately the same amount."
https://www.dailywire.com/news/electric-vehicles-catch-fire-after-hurricane-idalia-flooding,Daily Wire,right,Electric Vehicles Catch Fire After Hurricane Idalia Flooding,Daniel Chaitin,9/3/2023,"After Hurricane Idalia slammed into Florida last week, reports of electric vehicles catching fire after coming into contact with floodwaters began to emerge. At least two Tesla vehicles — one in Pinellas Park and another in Palm Harbor — ignited after being contaminated by saltwater from storm surge, according to ABC’s Tampa Bay affiliate. Palm Harbor Fire Rescue posted to Facebook about one of the incidents, warning that exposure to saltwater “can trigger combustion in lithium-ion batteries.” Electric vehicle owners were advised to move any car that came into recent contact with saltwater to immediately relocate the vehicle, specifically if it was parked in a garage. The list of potentially affected vehicles includes golf carts and electric scooters. “Salt particles get into the battery and other electrical components and they act as a conductor, leading to a short circuit and eventually a fire. And the risk of ignition lasts for weeks after a storm,” The Weather Channel’s Danielle Banks said in an explainer video. The battery packs are “encased in metal and hard to get to at the bottom of the cars,” Banks added. “The fire sometimes takes tens of thousands of gallons of water and hours of firefighting to extinguish and even then may reignite days later.” Tesla has a guidance page for owners whose vehicle has become submerged due to flooding or other extreme weather conditions on its website. Drivers are encouraged to treat their vehicle “as if it has been in an accident and contact your insurance company,” not to attempt to operate the vehicle without an inspection from an authorized shop, and to get the vehicle towed or otherwise moved at least 50 feet away from structures or “other combustible materials such as other cars and personal property.” Hurricane Idalia made landfall over Florida’s Gulf Coast near Keaton Beach on Wednesday, bringing with it strong winds, heavy rains, and storm surge. It has since swept across Florida and neighboring states and dissipated over the Atlantic Ocean. Authorities pushed drivers to move their electric vehicles to higher ground when the storm approached as a precaution. Other hurricanes are known to have caused electric vehicles to catch fire in the past, which led some officials and policymakers to question whether auto-makers are doing enough to develop safety protocols amid the Biden administration’s push for a transition away from gasoline-burning vehicles. USA Today reported that 21 electric vehicles are known to have burned in connection to flooding from Hurricane Ian in Florida and the Carolinas last year out of an estimated 358,000 damaged vehicles."

Whitmer’s order requires state agencies to shift the state government’s fleet of around 9,000 vehicles to electric beginning with light-duty cars by 2033 and moving on to medium- and heavy-duty vehicles by 2040. The governor’s directive came just a week after she signed one of the most extreme green energy bills in the nation, requiring utility providers to transition to completely carbon-free energy generation by the end of the next decade. “Michigan is on the cutting-edge of mobility and electrification,” Whitmer’s executive directive stated. “Our world-leading auto industry is making the switch to electric, and we continue to attract battery, semiconductor, and clean energy investments from other states and nations. We must usher the future of mobility and clean energy into Michigan by winning projects and leading by example in state government.” “Getting this done will help drive demand of Michigan-made electric vehicles, lower gas and maintenance costs for the state since ZEVs cost far less to fuel and maintain and reduce air and noise pollution in our communities,” Whitmer added in a statement. The executive order was short on details about the cost of transitioning the entire state government’s fleet of vehicles to electric. A 2021 report from the Michigan Department of Technology, Management, and Budget stated that the Michigan government has 8,788 on-road vehicles, which include dozens of buses and semi-trucks. Among the state agencies included in Whitmer’s directive is the Michigan State Police, which uses hundreds of coupes and sedans and over 1,000 SUVs for law enforcement. State agencies can request exemptions from the directive for certain vehicles, but must “offer alternative emission reduction options including hybrids,” according to Whitmer’s press release. Michigan House Republican Leader Matt Hall slammed Whitmer’s EV directive, telling The Daily Wire that the Democrats’ EV and green energy push is hurting the automotive industry and hard-working Michiganders. “Joe Biden and Gretchen Whitmer’s green energy schemes are accelerating the decline of Michigan’s automotive manufacturing industry, and the governor’s decision to replace all of Michigan’s state fleet with electric vehicles is just the latest step on this destructive path,” Hall said. “Michigan families have determined that EVs are too expensive and unreliable for them, which is why these vehicles are just sitting on car lots around the state.” Whitmer said the switch to EVs will help Michigan car manufacturers that are rapidly moving to EV production as the Biden administration pushes American car companies and consumers to get on board with its plan to have “50 percent of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030.” Of the nearly 9,000 vehicles operated by Michigan state government agencies, only three are electric, according to Whitmer’s communications director Bobby Leddy, The Detroit News reported. The governor’s executive directive is on par with her push for Michigan car manufacturers to embrace EVs as the future of transportation. In February, Whitmer announced plans for an EV battery plant in Marshall, Michigan, saying it is “expected to create 2,500 good-paying jobs” while helping “support Ford’s goal of producing two million electric vehicles annually by 2026.” That plan, however, came to a screeching halt in September when Ford paused the construction of the Marshall battery plant. Now, Ford says it’s scaling back its commitment to the Marshall plant, cutting 800 jobs and over $1 billion. Ford, one of Michigan’s “big three” car manufacturers, recently received a $9.2 billion loan from the Biden administration intended to help construct three electric vehicle battery plants — none of which are in Michigan — after the motor company projected the EV push would cost it $3 billion in 2023. That projection was bumped up to $4.5 billion in losses over EVs a few months later, meaning Ford lost around $32,000 for every EV it sold during the second quarter of 2023. “Democrats’ artificially accelerated shift to EVs will eliminate Michigan jobs at existing factories,” Hall told The Daily Wire. “And their mandates for unreliable green energy will lead to higher electricity prices on manufacturers — imposing additional costs on Michigan’s automotive industry that will kill more Michigan jobs and move more manufacturing overseas.”"

The group of 3,700 dealerships, which collectively sell every major brand of automakers in the U.S., said in a letter to Biden that his push to make two out of every three new cars sold by 2032 to be electric was highly unrealistic. While there were good options for people wishing to buy electric vehicles, “the reality, however, is that electric vehicle demand today is not keeping up with the large influx of BEVs [Battery Electric Vehicle] arriving at our dealerships prompted by the current regulations. BEVs are stacking up on our lots.” The dealerships said they’ve seen a drastic shift in demand for electric vehicles in just the last year and that they are arriving on their lots faster than they can be sold despite “deep price cuts, manufacturer incentives, and generous government incentives,” the letter said. “Mr. President, no government agency, no think tank, and no polling firm knows more about the automobile customer than us,” it continued. “Some customers are in the market for electric vehicles, and we are thrilled to sell them. But the majority of customers are simply not ready to make the change.” The dealerships cited numerous reasons that consumers do not want electric vehicles, including their high cost, the lack of garages for home charging, the lack of access for public charging, the loss of driving range in hot or cold weather, and the “dramatic loss of range” when towing. “Reliable charging networks, electric grid stability, sourcing of materials, and many other issues need time to resolve,” the letter said. “And finally, many people just want to make their own choice about what vehicle is right for them.” Mickey Anderson, president and chief executive officer of Baxter Auto Group, which owns and operates dealerships in several midwest states, said dealerships have “never seen a situation where government has intervened in such a draconian way.”"

Buttigieg made the comments during a CNN appearance — in response to a question about President Joe Biden’s visit to speak with striking auto workers on the United Auto Workers (UAW) picket lines in Michigan. WATCH: The Transportation Secretary referenced Biden’s appearance in Michigan and the fact that auto workers have voiced concerns about the transition to electric vehicles — and where that could leave their jobs moving forward. Buttigieg began with a callback to his hometown of South Bend, Indiana, where he name-dropped two local UAW chapters before pivoting to talk about the economy and the transition to electric vehicles. “Look, I come from South Bend, Indiana,” he said. “It’s the home of UAW Local 5 and UAW Local 9, I saw how the past generation of union auto jobs helped build the middle class build communities like the one I grew up in.” “I also saw what happened when those factories closed,” he continued. “What the UAW is trying to do right now is to make sure that this next chapter of auto industry, which, let’s be very clear, these cars are going electric with or without us.” While President Biden was on the picket line in Michigan, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) made an appearance at a UAW protest in Wentzville, Missouri — where he took aim at the Biden administration’s efforts to force the auto industry to go electric “with or without” the workers. “I’d call on the Biden Admin right now: Cancel all of your terrible electric mandates that are killing these guys and taking their jobs,” Hawley said. “And these companies … need to invest in America and in American workers.” "

Around 13,000 auto workers stopped working as picketing began outside a Ford factory in Wayne, Michigan; a GM assembly plant in Wentzville, Missouri; and a Stellantis Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio. The strike comes after weeks of negotiations between the union and leadership at the automakers. A CNN reporter was interviewing Farley when Tapper interrupted her and to point out what the head of the UAW was saying. “I just wanted to pass on a question based on something he told me the other day which is that over the last four years, each of the Big Three car manufacturers’ CEOs, in addition to their multimillion dollar salaries, they received on average of 40 percent pay increase,” Tapper said. “So why are the auto workers wanting a raise beyond what’s been asked, why is that so offensive compared to the 40 percent raises they have given themselves?” Farley said that the company was “really open to huge increases” in the “double digit” range, “increases we have never seen before, 20-plus percent.” Farley said that going to 40 percent would put the company out of business and that he refused to cut the company’s push for electric vehicles, despite losing $4.5 billion in the endeavor.

But if it prevents us from investing in this transition to EVs and in future products like the ones we have now, like new F-150, bestselling vehicle in the world — in the U.S., then everyone’s job is at risk if we don’t invest,” he said. Tapper pushed back, “It’s just there have been record auto profits, bailouts by the U.S. government. These huge raises that these CEOs are giving themselves, and I just wonder, why there isn’t more of a desire of the CEOs to have the workers share in the profits that are coming in to these automakers who just need we remind him were bailed outside by the U.S. taxpayer a few years ago?”"
https://nypost.com/2023/11/29/business/electric-vehicles-less-reliable-than-gas-powered-cars-trucks-consumer-reports/,New York Post ,right,"Electric vehicles less reliable than gas-powered cars, trucks: Consumer Reports",,11/29/2023,"Electric vehicles have proved far less reliable, on average, than gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and SUVs, according to the latest survey by Consumer Reports, which found that EVs from 2021 through 2023 model years encountered nearly 80% more problems than vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines. Consumer Reports said EV owners most frequently reported troubles with battery and charging systems as well as flaws in how the vehicles’ body panels and interior parts fit together. The magazine and website noted that EV manufacturers are still learning to construct completely new power systems, and it suggested that as they do, the overall reliability of electric vehicles should improve. Still, Consumer Reports noted that lingering concerns about reliability will likely add to the issues that give many buyers pause when considering a switch to the new technology, joining concerns about higher costs, too few charging stations, and long charging times. “This story is really one of growing pains,” said Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports. “It’s a story of just working out the bugs and the kinks of new technology.” The survey also concluded that plug-in hybrids, which can travel on battery power before a gas-electric powertrain kicks in, are more problem-prone than fully electric vehicles. Plug-ins, Fisher pointed out, contain two separate and complex power systems in which glitches can arise. He also noted that brands that over time have proved less reliable, in general, such as Jeep and Volvo, have started mass-producing plug-in hybrids. But tried-and-true integrated gas-electric hybrid systems are more reliable than gasoline vehicles, largely because they have been in use for about a quarter-century and the bugs have mostly been worked out, Fisher said. Consumer Reports derived its survey data from subscribers who owned EVs from the 2021 through 2023 model years and compared them with other vehicle types. In calculating a vehicle’s average problem rate, the organization assigned extra weight to serious problems such as battery or engine failures. EVs from the 2021 and 2022 model years overall had more than twice the problem rates of internal combustion vehicles. The rates were more closely aligned in the 2023 model year: Those EVs had only 21% more problems than gasoline vehicles, Fisher said. The narrower gap in problems between EVs and combustion vehicles in the 2023 model year, Fisher said, suggested that the reliability of EVs, in general, is improving. Still, he noted, newer vehicles tend to have lower problem rates that rise as they age. Among the EV owners whose vehicles have encountered trouble is Michael Coram of Lockport, NY, near Buffalo. In July, intent on reducing his commuting costs, Coram bought a 2023 Chevrolet Bolt electric SUV, attracted by its sporty handling. Coram, 44, a heating and air conditioning technician, said he ran into one annoying problem: On a chilly day in mid-November, his Bolt wouldn’t shift into drive. Eventually, after Coram had turned the car on and off 10 or 12 times, the problem fixed itself, and he hadn’t experienced it since. Other owners on a Bolt social media forum told Coram that he might have shifted into drive before the SUV’s computer had finished its startup sequence. “It kind of is a bit too much for the computer to handle,” he said. A Chevrolet Bolt GM’s Chevrolet Bolt has been the subject of a past recall. Now, Coram waits for all of the dashboard lights to go out before pushing the drive button. He said his dealer told him that mechanics would check the Bolt when a loaner car is available for him. In 2021, General Motors recalled its popular electric Bolt from the 2017 through 2022 model years to replace the batteries because of manufacturing defects that could cause fires. Fisher said Bolt owners had to limit how much they charged the batteries and had to park them outdoors until replacement batteries became available. Repairs were still being made this year, Fisher said, causing some Bolt owners to report problems in the Consumer Reports survey. In addition, owners of Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 EV reported battery and charging issues related to a charging control computer, which, in some cases, caused the vehicles to stall. Rivian, an upstart manufacturer of electric pickup trucks and SUVs, had trouble getting body panels to line up correctly and with broken interior parts, Fisher said. Tesla ranked 14th out of 30 automotive brands in the 2023 survey. Elon Musk’s Tesla, the EV sales leader, which now has years of experience building vehicles, showed improvement in reliability, Fisher said. This was largely because a high proportion of Tesla’s sales involved the relatively small and less-expensive Model Y SUV and Model 3 cars. Those are simpler to build and lack the glitch-prone new technology that Telsa offers in its more expensive vehicles, the Models S and X. Tesla ranked 14th out of 30 automotive brands in the 2023 survey, up from 19th in 2022. Lexus, Toyota’s luxury brand, was the most reliable in the survey, followed by Toyota, Mini, Acura and Honda. The five lowest-ranking brands were Jeep, Volkswagen, Rivian, Mercedes-Benz, and Chrysler. The most reliable segment of the market was compact cars, followed by sportscars, small pickups, midsize and large cars, and luxury midsize and large cars. Electric cars, electric SUVs, full-size pickups, midsize pickups, and electric pickups had the worst reliability. Consumer Reports says its survey of subscribers, representing 330,000 vehicles, took place last spring and summer. It asked owners of vehicles from 2000 through 2023 model years, with a smattering of 2024 models, about problems they had experienced in the previous 12 months."
https://nypost.com/2023/02/11/as-electric-car-sales-surge-their-benefits-are-increasingly-criticized/,New York Post ,right,"As electric car sales surge, their benefits are increasingly criticized","David Kaufman, James B Meigs",2/11/2023,"The popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) has never been buzzier. Across the U.S, EV sales jumped by two-thirds last year to over 807,000 cars, according to Wall Street Journal reports. Fully electric vehicles now make up 5.8 % of all cars and light trucks sold in the US, up from 3.2% just a year earlier. Options for EV buyers are increasing as well, as Ford, Hyundai, Kia—along with startups including electric pickup maker Rivian — edge in on turf long dominated by Elon Musk’s Tesla. But the EV revolution isn’t happening fast enough to satisfy everyone. “We have to take combustion-engine vehicles off the road as rapidly as we can,” then-candidate Joe Biden said in 2019. Since taking office, Biden has made the shift to electric vehicles one of his top environmental priorities. Back in late 2021, the president told automakers he expects EVs to make up 50% of their new vehicle sales by 2030. The White House is enforcing this “voluntary” policy with a combination of carrots and sticks. The carrots include plans to spend nearly $15 billion building EV charging stations and subsidizing domestic battery production. As for sticks, the administration has issued draconian fuel-efficiency standards requiring that each carmaker’s gas-guzzling fleet achieve an average of 55 miles per gallon by 2026. Voters would likely balk if the White House began to ban traditional internal combustion engines (ICE). But Manhattan Institute economist Jonathan Lesser argues the new fuel standards actually impose that goal in a stealthier fashion. The new rules constitute “an electric vehicle mandate by regulatory fiat,” he writes. In other words, Biden is using executive decrees to position EVs as the backbone of the nation’s automotive future. Political leaders in New York, California, and other states aren’t even trying to be stealthy. New York Governor Kathy Hochul and California’s Gavin Newsom have both signed measures severely limiting ICE sales over the next few years, and banning them outright by 2035. “We can solve this climate crisis if we focus on the big, bold steps necessary to cut pollution,” Newsom said last August. These leaders often talk as if shifting to electric cars is the boldest step our nation can take to help the planet. In reality, policies forcing carmakers to build EVs—and forcing drivers to buy them—are misguided. Even if all Americans traded their gas-powered cars for electric vehicles, the transition would yield only modest reductions in emissions. Moreover, the policies intended to push people into buying EVs rely on un-American levels of coercion. To be clear, the EVs are technological marvels and a blast to drive. But the promise of electric vehicles has been oversold. EVs are not an environmental panacea. And, for now at least, they don’t make sense for most drivers. It’s no coincidence that Tesla, America’s most popular EV brand, was born in California’s Silicon Valley. The roads are smooth, the weather is mild, and the people are rich. California EV owners can charge their cars in their own suburban garages and drive them modest distances to work or out to dinner. But most Americans don’t live in balmy Palo Alto. Many have to contend with very cold or hot weather, which can dramatically reduce an EV’s range. Others drive rural roads, where chargers may be scarce. And city residents often lack personal garages where they can plug in. Nonetheless, the federal government wants to see an EV in every driveway, and offers subsidies of up to $7,500 to people who buy them. Not surprisingly, most of that subsidy money winds up in the pockets of well-off car buyers. Meanwhile, battery-powered cars and trucks still can’t do all the things people expect from their ICE vehicles. For example, Motor Trend magazine recently tested the towing-capacity of Ford’s hot-selling F-150 Lightning pickup. They discovered that hooking a full-sized camper trailer to the $92,000 EV truck reduced the pickup’s range to a nail-biting 90 miles. EVs are also more expensive than comparable ICE vehicles—and prices are still rising. According to J.D. Power, the average new EV sold for $66,000 last year, up from $51,000 the year before and far higher than the $45,844 price tag for an average ICE last year. Driving an EV now also costs slightly more per mile than driving a mid-priced ICE, according to the Anderson Economic Group. Time is another factor. Tesla owners like to brag about plugging into the high-voltage “Superchargers,” which can pump 200 miles worth of juice into a car’s batteries in about 20 minutes. But most public charging stations are of the less powerful Level 2 type. These can take eight hours or more to fully charge a vehicle. (Many home chargers take even longer.) Meanwhile, it takes less than four minutes to fill the tank of a typical ICE car. EVs are often touted as “zero-emission vehicles.” But calculating their true environmental footprint is surprisingly tricky. Yes, EVs emit no tailpipe emissions. So, if an EV is charged with low-carbon electricity—say from nuclear, hydropower, solar, or wind—that adds up to very a clean operation. However, if you live in a state that mostly burns coal for electric power—like Utah, Indiana, or Kentucky—your car’s carbon footprint will approach that of an ICE vehicle. And EVs only reduce emissions if people actually drive them instead of a comparable ICE vehicle. Researcher from the University of Chicago recently concluded tat he typical EV is only driven 5,300 miles per year, ‘about half the US fleet average’.” It appears affluent EV owners use their electric cars when it’s convenient but rely on their conventional cars or trucks for about half their travel. Of course, an EV that mostly sits in a driveway doesn’t do much to bring down emissions. Which is why, as those University of Chicago researchers concluded, “electricity may not be as easily substituted for gasoline as previously thought.” It is also important to consider the environmental impact of the car itself. A typical EV battery pack contains about 25 pounds of lithium, 30 pounds of cobalt, 60 pounds of nickel, 90 pounds of copper, and hundreds of pounds of other materials. All those minerals must be mined, processed (mostly in China), and shipped around the world—which takes energy and creates pollution. Is all that environmental disruption worth it? Most experts calculate that the lifetime emissions from an EV are still somewhat lower than those of a comparable ICE vehicles. But not everyone agrees. And those “lifecycle” calculations assume the EV will be driven as much as a combustion vehicle, which, as that California study showed, probably isn’t the case. Even today’s relatively modest production of electric vehicles is putting strains on mineral supplies. The price of lithium has climbed roughly 1,000 % since 2020. (That’s one reason EV prices are surging.) One group of analysts predicts the global demand for lithium will grow by a factor of 40 over the next two decades. This shortage of critical materials is one reason some automakers are skeptical about electric vehicle hype. “EVs are just going to take longer to become mainstream than media would like us to believe,” Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda said last year. Unsurprisingly, his company is exploring hydrogen fuel cells and other low-carbon technologies, in addition to EVs. Investors too are becoming more realistic about EV prospects. Tesla’s stock—which was once worth more than all the world’s major car companies combined—has fallen by roughly half since its late 2021 high. Washington might also consider accepting a similar dose of reality, with federal policymakers rolling back efforts to force us all into electric vehicles overnight. Offering subsidies to help affluent people buy luxury cars is unfair, and according to a recent Harvard study, might even boost overall emissions. If politicians are serious about reducing those emissions, they should focus on making the U.S. power grid cleaner. For example, we should trim regulations that give local activists too much leverage to block power-line projects like Missouri’s proposed Grain Belt Express. And the Nuclear Regulatory Commission needs to streamline approvals for the next generation of super-safe nuclear plants. That way we can have enough cheap, clean power for the people who do want to drive EVs—not to mention installing home heat pumps or electrifying dirty industries now reliant on fossil fuels. Governments generally aren’t very good at picking the technologies of tomorrow. Maybe the car of the future will run on batteries, maybe it will be hydrogen fuel cells, maybe it will be super-efficient combustion engines. Nobody knows for sure, least of all state and federal bureaucrats. While is why instead of limiting our choices, our leaders should let innovation flourish, and let Americans drive what they want. "
https://nypost.com/2022/11/08/face-it-electric-cars-dont-do-much-of-anything-for-the-environment/,New York Post ,right,Face it: Electric cars don’t do much of anything for the environment,John Stossel,11/8/2023,"Electric-car sales are up 66% this year. President Joe Biden promotes them, saying things like “The great American road trip is going to be fully electrified” and “There’s no turning back.” To make sure we have no choice in the matter, some left-leaning states have moved to ban gas-powered cars altogether. California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order banning them by 2035. Oregon, Massachusetts and New York copied California. Washington state’s politicians said they’d make it happen even faster, by 2030. Thirty countries also say they’ll phase out gas-powered cars. But this is just dumb. It will not happen. It’s magical thinking. Let me point out some “inconvenient” facts about electric cars, simple truths that politicians and green activists just don’t seem to understand. “Electric cars are amazing,” says physicist Mark Mills of the Manhattan Institute. “But they won’t change the future in any significant way [as far as] oil use or carbon dioxide emissions.”Inconvenient fact No. 1: Selling more electric cars won’t reduce oil use very much. “The world has 15, 18 million electric vehicles now,” says Mills. “If we (somehow) get to 500 million, that would reduce world oil consumption by about 10%. That’s not nothing, but it doesn’t end the use of oil.” Most of the world’s oil is used by things like “airplanes, buses, big trucks and the mining equipment that gets the copper to build the electric cars. Even if all vehicles somehow did switch to electricity, there’s another problem: Electricity isn’t very green. I laugh talking to friends who are all excited about their electric car, assuming it doesn’t pollute. They go silent when I ask, “Where does your car’s electricity come from?”They don’t know. They haven’t even thought about it. Inconvenient fact No. 2: Although driving an electric car puts little additional carbon into the air, producing the electricity to charge its battery adds plenty. Most of America’s electricity is produced by burning natural gas and coal. Just 12% comes from wind or solar power. Auto companies don’t advertise that. “Electric vehicles in general are better and more sustainable for the environment,” says Ford’s Linda Zhang in a BBC interview. “She’s not stupid,” he replies. “But ignorance speaks to what you know. You have to mine, somewhere on earth, 500,000 pounds of minerals and rock to make one battery.” American regulations make mining difficult, so most of it is done elsewhere, polluting those countries. Some mining is done by children. Some is done in places that use slave labor. Even if those horrors didn’t exist, mining itself adds lots of carbon to the air. “If you’re worried about carbon dioxide,” says Mills, “the electric vehicle has emitted 10 to 20 tons of carbon dioxide [from the mining, manufacturing and shipping] before it even gets to your driveway.” “Volkswagen published an honest study [that points out] that the first 60,000 miles or so you’re driving an electric vehicle, that electric vehicle will have emitted more carbon dioxide than if you just drove a conventional vehicle.” You would have to drive an electric car “100,000 miles” to reduce emissions by just “20% or 30%, which is not nothing, but it’s not zero.” No, it’s not. If you live in New Zealand, where there’s lots of hydro and geothermal power, electric cars pollute less. But in America, your “zero-emission vehicle” adds lots of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. Politicians and electric-car sellers don’t mention that. Most probably don’t even know. In a future column, three more inconvenient facts about electric cars."
https://nypost.com/2023/04/12/epa-proposes-strict-emission-rules-puts-emphasis-on-electric-vehicles/,New York Post ,right,Biden pitches strict emissions rules to make most cars electric by 2032,Mark Moore,4/12/2023,"The White House proposed sweeping new automobile pollution standards Wednesday that would require more than two-thirds of new vehicles to be electric within the next decade — about 10 times the number currently sold in the US at prices that hit inflation-weary Americans even harder in the pocketbook. The proposed restrictions for new cars and trucks, announced by the Environmental Protection Agency, would apply to the 2027 to 2032 model years and be the strictest ever imposed on US automakers while accelerating the shift from gas-powered vehicles to battery-powered automobiles. The White House said the changes would cut carbon dioxide emissions by 10 billion tons, reduce the nation’s reliance on imported oil and save Americans about $12,000 over the life of a vehicle. But while a number of US car makers are now rolling out electric vehicles, they arrive at the dealer with a high degree of sticker shock. The average price of an electric vehicle in March 2023 was $58,940 compared to $48,008 for a gas-powered car, according to Kelley Blue Book.And while the price of gas-powered cars fell 1.1% from February to March, the price for EVs rose 0.5% over that same two-month period, the company said in a release Tuesday.Meanwhile, Americans are still reluctant to get behind the wheel of a battery-powered car, citing the high purchase price and too few charging stations, according to a Associated Press/NORC/EPIC poll released Tuesday. According to the survey, 60% say they’re putting off buying an EV because the price is too high, while 50% believe there aren’t enough charging stations. Another 40% just prefer a gas-powered car.“I’m an internal combustion engine kind of guy,” Robert Piascik, 65, a musician who lives in Westerville, Ohio, told the AP. “I can’t see myself spending a premium to buy something that I don’t like as much as the lower-priced option,” he said. About half of the respondents in the AP/NORC/EPIC poll — 47% — say their next car likely won’t be an electric one, while 22% say it’s somewhat likely. ​​Only 19% say it’s “very” or “extremely” likely that they would buy an electric vehicle the next time they buy a car. ​ The EPA proposals call for 60% of new passenger vehicles to be electric by 2030, with that number hitting 67% by 2032. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said the EPA’s proposals will be bad for everyday Americans​.“Joe Biden wants to make two out of every three new cars electric by 2032,” he said Wednesday on Twitter. “​These rules may please his climate donors, but they’ll hurt the vast majority of Americans who can’t use, can’t afford, or don’t want electric​,” Cotton said. ​​ Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the ranking Republican on the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, ​called the proposed new regulations “misguided.”​ “Today, the Biden administration made clear it wants to decide for Americans what kinds of cars and trucks we are allowed to buy, lease, and drive​,” the West Virginia lawmaker said in a statement, adding that the average cost of an EV is more than the household income of 46% of American families. ​”​These misguided emissions standards were made without considering the supply chain challenges American automakers are still facing, the lack of sufficiently operational electric vehicle charging infrastructure, or the fact that it takes nearly a decade to permit a mine to extract the minerals needed to make electric vehicles, forcing businesses to look to China for these raw materials​,” she said.But White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi said under the Biden administration EV sales have tripled and the models available have doubled. “The automakers have … technology and the infrastructure and supply chain to be able to achieve this with the lead time they’ve got,″ Zaidi said. The $1 trillion infrastructure bill signed by President Biden in November 2021 includes a federal strategy to build 500,000 charging stations across the country and also includes a $7,500 tax credit to lower the cost of EVs.

https://nypost.com/2023/02/02/electric-cars-may-reduce-severe-asthma-attacks-study/,New York Post ,right,"Electric cars may reduce severe asthma attacks, improve lung health: study",Brooke Kato,2/2/2023,"These findings are a breath of fresh air. A new study from the University of Southern California shows a potential link between electric cars and improved lung health. Researchers from the Keck School of Medicine at USC analyzed the number of asthma-related hospital visits compared to electric car ownership in the Golden State. They discovered that for every 20 electrical vehicles per 1,000 people, there was a 3.2% decrease in annual emergency room visits due to asthma-related incidents. As an added bonus, there was also a slight dip in levels of nitrogen dioxide, which can harm the respiratory system. The team of researchers was curious to know if detectable differences in health and air quality were present despite “relatively low levels” of electric vehicle usage.Using data collected from 2013 to 2019, the study, published in the Science of Total Environment, evaluated ZIP codes by electric vehicle ownership. It found that areas with lower socioeconomic status and educational achievement had fewer electric cars, referred to as the “adoption gap.” “The impacts of climate change on health can be challenging to talk about because they can feel very scary,” study author Dr. Sandrah Eckel, an associate professor of population and public health sciences at the university, said in a statement. “We’re excited about shifting the conversation towards climate change mitigation and adaptation, and these results suggest that transitioning to [electric vehicles] is a key piece of that.” Pollution is a known killer, as many other studies have shown that excessive exposure to poor-quality air can cause significant health issues and even fatalities.Last year, a report declared that 9 million people die annually from pollution-related problems – many of which could be avoided and remedied if the air could be improved. In fact, a different report revealed that a majority of the world’s population is inhaling toxic air – 99% to be exact. Symptoms and ailments caused by unhealthy air include coughing, wheezing, chronic asthma and cancer. Other studies have examined the short-term effects of pollution and poor air quality, namely on brain cognition. Research from last month detailed the potential link between car exhaust and impaired brain function, while another claimed lower-quality air hindered the minds of chess players and caused them to make poor decisions. While electrical vehicles are just a small piece of the puzzle, the USC researchers encourage further analysis of their role in mitigating the pollution crisis. Their study could serve as the blueprint – potential proof, upon further research, that change can occur at a local level, they assert.“When we think about the actions related to climate change, often it’s on a global level,” USC study author Dr. Erika Garcia, an assistant professor of population and public health sciences at the university, said in a statement. “But the idea that changes being made at the local level can improve the health of your own community could be a powerful message to the public and to policymakers.”"
https://nypost.com/2023/11/07/opinion/taxpayers-are-subsidizing-rich-electric-vehicle-owners-to-the-tune-of-billions/,New York Post ,right,Taxpayers are subsidizing rich electric-vehicle owners — to the tune of billions,"EJ Antoni, Anthony F Esposito",11/7/2023,"A new report has exposed electric vehicles as wasteful money pits, living up to the adage: If it seems too good to be true, it is. EV proponents often claim they’re cheaper to own than conventional gas- or diesel-powered vehicles, but that’s simply not true after accounting for the billions of dollars in costs government subsidies and mandates quietly conceal. The stark reality is the average EV costs at least $53,000 more over 10 years than conventional vehicles, effectively doubling the price of the average new car. But $22 billion in government handouts to EV owners and manufacturers absorb the extra expense at every stage of the vehicle’s life, from raw-material sourcing to battery charging. Examining the numbers behind recharging makes this very clear. While EV advocates claim charging costs are equivalent to $1.21-per-gallon gasoline, the real amount is an order of magnitude more. Including the charging equipment, subsidies from governments and utilities and other frequently excluded expenses, the true cost of charging an EV is equivalent to $17.33-per-gallon gasoline — but the EV owner pays less than 7% of that. Over 10 years, almost $12,000 of costs per EV are transferred to utility ratepayers and taxpayers, effectively socializing the price of recharging an EV while keeping the benefits private. Due to high entry price points — the average EV costs $58,000, the average gas vehicle $33,000 — most EV consumers are affluent. This is socialism for the rich: a transfer of costs from higher net-worth individuals to middle- and lower-income taxpayers. It’s the equivalent of levying taxes and fees on public-transportation users and those who walk or bicycle to work and using the money to reduce the price of gasoline. Everyone without a car would be furious if they found out their money was effectively being given away like this. But that’s precisely what’s happening with EVs. One reason EV recharging costs so much is the tremendous energy density of gasoline and diesel. A single horsepower is 746 watts, so the engine in a typical American sedan is strong enough to provide more than the maximum amount of electricity four typical American homes are wired to handle. Conversely, recharging a typical EV at home can consume 10,000 watts at any given time, roughly eight times the power an American home consumes on average. Not only does recharging an EV require a large amount of electricity; it requires infrastructure capable of handling that much power. Most major utilities have already conceded they won’t be able to meet the significant capacity additions needed to support proposed EV mandates. Instead, utilities are reduced to begging customers to recharge during off-peak hours, often offering incentives like lower rates or bill credits. Both the vast subsidization of EV recharging and the impracticality of making it a widespread practice are emblematic of the production and sale of EVs as well. Average direct subsidies from federal and state governments amount to almost $9,000 per vehicle over 10 years while direct subsidies from utilities push the amount over $10,000. But manufacturers receive subsidies too, and regulations force them to produce more and more EVs, even if the vehicles aren’t profitable. The regulatory environment is so onerous and blatantly favors EVs, auto manufacturers can’t meet a range of federal requirements without shifting an increasing percentage of production toward EVs, even if consumers don’t want them. Between corporate average fuel economy standards and Environmental Protection Agency rules, “EVs receive nearly seven times more credit,” the Texas Public Policy Foundation report notes, “than they provide in actual fuel economy benefits.” Thus EVs have become the only way for auto manufacturers to comply with increasingly stringent regulations that will soon make conventional vehicles illegal — no matter how much consumers would rather have a gas- or diesel-powered vehicle.Subsidies and regulatory credits amount to almost $50,000 per EV over a decade. Amazingly, even with all these subsidies, mandates and other incentives, the report points out manufacturers are still losing tens of thousands of dollars per EV; consumers clearly don’t want them in the volume they’re being produced. That’s why they’re piling up on dealer lots. The lack of demand has led GM and Ford to recently announce they must reduce battery production. What’s even more amazing is the report actually underestimates the total cost of converting America entirely to EVs because it doesn’t attempt to measure many other additional costs. These include billions of taxpayer dollars spent on electric buses, charging stations at airports, city taxpayer-funded subsidies and California-specific subsidies.There are also many indirect costs like the disproportionate road damage caused by EVs, which are heavier than conventional vehicles. Politicians can hide behind words like they hide the true cost of EVs behind subsidies and handouts, but the numbers don’t lie: EVs can cost twice as much as conventional vehicles, and that’s a losing deal for the taxpayers funding these money pits.

https://nypost.com/2023/10/19/nyc-lifts-cap-on-for-hire-cars-provided-theyre-electric/,New York Post ,right,NYC lifts cap on for-hire cars — provided they’re electric,Nolan Hicks,10/19/2023,"The Big Apple has lifted the cap on the number of cars ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft can have on the city’s roads — but there’s one catch, the vehicles must be electric. Officials hope the move, which begins Thursday, will help expand the fleet of for-hire cars in the city from the current tally of 78,000 back toward the pre-pandemic number of nearly 100,000. It’s part of a push by Mayor Eric Adams and the Taxi and Limousine Commission to shift the vehicles used by the ride-hailing services from gas power to being either battery powered or handicap accessible by 2030. “Anyone with an electric vehicle can put in an application to be a ride share driver, put even more New Yorkers on the road to opportunity, jobs, employment, economic possibilities but doing it in a clean way,” said Mayor Eric Adams, at a pre-rollout event earlier this week. These new regulations will require that Uber, Lyft and other ride hailing companies move 5% of their rides in cars that are either electric or can fit a wheelchair by the end of 2024 — a tally that already sits at 10%, officials say.The goal then moves to 15% of trips by the end of 2025, 25% by the end of 2026; 40% by the end of 2027 and then increasing by 20 percentage points annually until gas cars that can’t fit wheelchairs are entirely phased out of the fleets by the end of 2030. Officials says that allows any driver who purchases a car this year to get the average seven-year life out of a fleet car purchased this year before requiring its replacement. “This will be a gradual measured transition,” said TLC commissioner David Do. Ridehailing companies had already promised to switch their fleets over before the city first announced in January that it would roll out the regulations. These new regulations do not apply to either the yellow or green cab fleets.The union representing drivers for Uber and Lyft celebrated the new licenses as an opportunity to let drivers who currently lease their cars to finally own them, but is pushing for additional protections including the installation of more charging stations. “[W]e continue to have concerns over affordability and feasibility for drivers. We all support a cleaner future for New York, but it cannot be funded on the backs of our city’s hardworking Uber and Lyft drivers,” said Brendan Sexton, the head of the drivers guild, in a staetment. City officials first capped the number of ride-hail cars that could operate in 2018 as it sought to protect the besieged yellow cab business from Uber and Lyft, which were using the vast amounts of money they raised from investors to offer customers cut-rate fares.The policy, at the time, included an exemption for electric cars, but the TLC slammed that door shut in 2021 when a startup, Revel, attempted to use the loophole to enter the New York market. Ultimately, the company was allowed to launch its car fleet because it got its application in before the TLC issued its rule change."
https://nypost.com/2023/07/21/electric-car-owners-fed-up-with-overly-complicated-tech-features-survey/,New York Post ,right,"Electric car owners fed up with useless, overly complicated tech features: survey",Shannon Thaler,7/21/2023,"As automakers race into the electric vehicle market, car owners are getting fed up with their recent designs — and irked that simple controls like air conditioning and built-in audio are embedded inside high-tech software that’s hard to use. JD Power’s Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout (APEAL) Study, is based on 10 factors — nine of which have declined, JD Power reported. Those include customers’ approval of their vehicle’s built-in infotainment systems — the hub of air controls, GPS systems, music, and more that’s often displayed on a touchscreen in today’s car models. The survey found that only 56% of owners prefer to use their vehicle’s built-in system to play audio — a sharp decline from 70% in 2020. In addition, infotainment systems’ three most common features — phone calls, voice recognition, and navigation — are slipping down the popularity scale. Only 45%, 37%, and 43%, respectively, of owners, prefer to use these built-in features in 2023.While the APEAL study measures overall customer satisfaction on a 1,000-point scale, respondents came in at 845 this year. That’s two points lower than it was in 2022 and three points lower than in 2021, marking the first time the study saw a consecutive year-over-year decline in satisfaction in 28 years.The results were derived from responses from 84,555 owners of 2023 model-year vehicles after 90 days of ownership, collected between February and May. It could be that drivers are instead opting for smartphone-mirroring techs like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. According to CarPlay’s site, “more than 800” car models on the market today support the Apple-backed tech. Android’s site, meanwhile, touts that Auto is supported in “over 500 models.” “Built-in infotainment systems are a prime example of a technology not resonating with today’s buyers,” JD Power concluded.However, the satisfaction rate for native operating systems that are developed by Google rather than the automaker could serve as a glimmer of hope for infotainment. JD Power reported that models with Google’s Android Automotive hardware that came with Google Automotive’s operating system (GAS) — dubbed AAOS — “scored higher in the infotainment category than those with no AAOS whatsoever.” GM, Volvo, and Ford have all said that GAS will be integrated into current and future models. Ford’s newest electric vehicle, the F-150 Lightning, however, boasts in own native infotainment system that its website touts as compatible with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.Its rival, Tesla, has an entirely separate information and entertainment hub, which it calls the Toybox, that boasts features like a pedestrian warning system, a prank button that’ll make a fart noise when someone gets into their seat, and a personal music studio called TRAX. The features aren’t doing much for customer satisfaction, though, JD Power’s report showed.Out of 1,000 points, Tesla scored 878 — below Jaguar, Land Rover, and Porsche and tied with BMW. The score is nine points lower than in 2022 when Tesla was first included in the APEAL Study."

The move is the latest sign that electric vehicle production and demand may not be as strong as forecast. GM had been set to begin production of the electric Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra in late 2024 at the suburban Detroit plant. The company said the plan now is to start it in late 2025. The delay is happening “to better manage capital investment while aligning with EV demand,” the automaker told The Post on Wednesday. Though EV sales in the US grew 51% in the first nine months of the year, the advance is well below the 71% sales surge in vehicles for the same period last year. In addition, the 50% increase in the first nine months of 2023 trails the 65% growth for all of 2022, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing Motor Intelligence data.While the EV plans are paused, the automaker said it will work on implementing engineering improvements “to increase the profitability of our products.” A GM spokesperson told The Post that delaying the Orion Assembly plant’s transformation has nothing to do with the ongoing strike by United Auto Workers union against the Big Three — which has shut down major factories, prompting Ford and GM to lay off a combined 500 staffers this month. GM is set to begin building the GMC Sierra EV next year in Detroit. General Motors said on Tuesday it still plans to end production of the Chevrolet Bolt EV at the end of 2023. GM, which vows to end the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035, sells few EVs in the United States outside the Bolt. Just 2.8% of its total U.S. sales this year are EVs. Industry leader Tesla slashed prices by up to 20% on many of its popular models at the start of the year after the company’s failure to meet Wall Street’s delivery estimates for 2022. Tesla will report its third-quarter earnings after the markets close on Wednesday. Tesla’s price cuts had a ripple effect through the competitive EV marketplace, dropping the average price for an EV from nearly $59,000 in January to $48,000 in September, per the The Journal, which reviewed Cox Automotive data. Dwindling demand has also caused Ford to consider canceling its own shift in factory production on its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck, which recently had its price slashed by $10,000 in an about-face by the automaker that just months earlier had raised the prices of its EV models. Meanwhile, luxury EV maker Lucid Motors has been struggling to hit its production targets, producing just 6,737 vehicles so far this year with a goal to build 10,000 EVs by the end of the year, according to The Journal.Shares of Lucid — which is run by an ex-Tesla engineer — are down about 80% since the company’s Nasdaq debut in 2021 following a merger with Churchill Capital Corp. in a deal that valued the company at $24 billion. As of Wednesday, Lucid’s share price sits at $4.65, down nearly 25% year to date, and the company has a market cap of $10.62 billion."
https://nypost.com/2023/09/03/ex-auto-honcho-bob-lutz-trashes-us-goal-for-electric-car-sales/,New York Post ,right,Ex-auto honcho trashes US goal for electric car sales as pipe dream,Carl Campanile,9/3/2023,"The goal to prod a majority of Americans into buying emission-free electric cars over the next decade is a pipe dream, a former executive at three top US automakers said Sunday. “The regulation is way ahead of the public,” Bob Lutz — ex-exec at General Motors, Ford and Chrysler — told John Catsimatidis on WABC 770 AM’s the Cats Roundtable. “The American public is not ready for the broad adoption of electric vehicles.” “We don’t have enough electricity-generating infrastructure,” he scoffed. President Biden aims to make electric car buys up to 60% of all new vehicle sales by 2030 to reduce carbon emissions — and make up two out of three sales by 2032. New York and California both have aggressive rules to phase out gas-powered cars for electric autos.Lutz guessed 10% to 12% of drivers may want electric cars. “That’s good,” he said. “But the remainder still wants internal combustion.”“This transition by 2030 is just not going to happen,” he added. “What will happen is … everybody will continue to make a lot of internal-combustion vehicles, which sell. And they’ll make electric vehicles, which even now are not selling at the pace that everybody would like.” According to Lutz, “what will happen is that the governments … are going to have to … push out the deadline. Or, if it’s an authoritarian government like China, they’ll just say, ‘You either buy an electric vehicle or you buy no vehicle at all.’ “Well, that may work in China. But it’s not going to work in the United States or Europe. What will happen … is the deadline will get pushed out and pushed out and pushed out.”Lutz said Americans should consider buying an electric car and see if they like it — particularly if they’re not regularly driving long distances that would necessitate pit stops to charge up. “The government fuel economy rules … cannot be met without broad-scale electrification. What we’re seeing is electrification [adoption] that could occur naturally, because there’s a lot to be said for electric vehicles. But right now, it’s being forced by governments for environmental reasons,” he said. Also in the interview, Lutz called former Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca the best auto boss he had — and praised current GM CEO Mary Barra, who worked under Lutz when he an executive there."
https://apnews.com/article/electric-vehicles-consumer-reports-gasoline-vehicles-charging-eed9c3b8d86c1f7708b7c6e2d4dbf55e,Associated Press,middle,"Consumer Reports: Electric vehicles less reliable, on average, than conventional cars and trucks",Tom Krisher,11/29/2023,"DETROIT (AP) — Electric vehicles have proved far less reliable, on average, than gasoline-powered cars, trucks and SUVs, according to the latest survey by Consumer Reports, which found that EVs from the 2021 through 2023 model years encountered nearly 80% more problems than did vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines. Consumer Reports said EV owners most frequently reported troubles with battery and charging systems as well as flaws in how the vehicles’ body panels and interior parts fit together. The magazine and website noted that EV manufacturers are still learning to construct completely new power systems, and it suggested that as they do, the overall reliability of electric vehicles should improve. “This story is really one of growing pains,” said Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports. “It’s a story of just working out the bugs and the kinks of new technology.” Still, Consumer Reports noted that lingering concerns about reliability will likely add to the issues that give many buyers pause when considering a switch to the new technology, joining concerns about higher costs, too few charging stations and long charging times. The growth of electric vehicle sales has slowed sharply since last year. In June 2022, EV sales were growing about 90% year over year. By June of this year the 12-month growth rate had slowed to about 50%, and automakers have become increasingly fearful that the pace will weaken further. Reflecting that concern, about 3,900 U.S. auto dealers this week signed a letter to President Joe Biden, asking him to rethink what the dealers called unrealistic fuel economy and emissions requirements that could require electric vehicles to reach 67% of total U.S. vehicle sales by 2032. Consumer enthusiasm for EVs, their letter warned, has stalled. “They are not selling nearly as fast as they are arriving at our dealerships, even with deep price cuts, manufacturer incentives and generous government incentives,” the letter said. The Consumer Reports survey also concluded that plug-in hybrids, which can travel on battery power before a gas-electric powertrain kicks in, are more problem-prone than fully electric vehicles. Plug-ins, Fisher pointed out, contain two separate and complex power systems in which glitches can arise. He also noted that brands that over time have proved less reliable, in general, such as Jeep and Volvo, have started mass-producing plug-in hybrids. But tried-and-true integrated gas-electric hybrid systems are more reliable than gasoline vehicles, largely because they have been in use for about a quarter-century and the bugs have mostly been worked out, Fisher said. Consumer Reports derived its survey data from subscribers who owned EVs from the 2021 through 2023 model years and compared them with other vehicle types. In calculating a vehicle’s average problem rate, the organization assigned extra weight to serious problems such as battery or engine failures. EVs from the 2021 and 2022 model years overall had more than twice the problem rates of internal combustion vehicles. The rates were more closely aligned in the 2023 model year: Those EVs had only 21% more problems than gasoline vehicles, Fisher said. The narrower gap in problems between EVs and combustion vehicles in the 2023 model year, Fisher said, suggested that the reliability of EVs, in general, is improving. Still, he noted, newer vehicles tend to have lower problem rates that rise as they age. Among the EV owners who have had problems with their vehicles is Michael Coram of Lockport, New York, near Buffalo. In July, intent on reducing his commuting costs, Coram bought a 2023 Chevrolet Bolt electric SUV, attracted by its sporty handling. Coram, 44, a heating and air conditioning technician, said he ran into one annoying problem: On a chilly day in mid-November, his Bolt wouldn’t shift into drive. Eventually, after Coram had turned the car on and off 10 or 12 times, the problem fixed itself, and he hasn’t experienced it since. Other owners on a Bolt social media forum told Coram that he might have shifted into drive before the SUV’s computer had finished its startup sequence. “It kind of is a bit too much for the computer to handle,” he said. Now, Coram waits for all of the dashboard lights to go out before pushing the drive button. He said his dealer told him that mechanics will check the Bolt when a loaner car is available for him. In 2021, General Motors recalled its popular electric Bolt from the 2017 through 2022 model years to replace the batteries because of manufacturing defects that could cause fires. Fisher said Bolt owners had to limit how much they charged the batteries and had to park them outdoors until replacement batteries became available. Repairs were still being made this year, Fisher said, causing some Bolt owners to report problems in the Consumer Reports survey. In addition, owners of Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 EV reported battery and charging issues related to a charging control computer, which, in some cases, caused the vehicles to stall. Rivian, an upstart manufacturer of electric pickup trucks and SUVs, had trouble getting body panels to line up correctly and with broken interior parts, Fisher said. Tesla, the EV sales leader, which now has years of experience building vehicles, showed improvement in reliability, Fisher said. This was largely because a high proportion of Tesla’s sales involve the relatively small and less-expensive Model Y SUV and Model 3 cars. Those are simpler to build and lack the glitch-prone new technology that Telsa offers in its more expensive vehicles, the Models S and X. Tesla ranked 14th out of 30 automotive brands in the 2023 survey, up from 19th in 2022. Lexus, Toyota’s luxury brand, was the most reliable in the survey, followed by Toyota, Mini, Acura and Honda. The five lowest-ranking brands were Jeep, Volkswagen, Rivian, Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler. The most reliable segment of the market was compact cars, followed by sportscars, small pickups, midsize and large cars, luxury midsize and large cars. Electric cars, electric SUVs, full-size pickups, midsize pickups, and electric pickups had the worst reliability. Consumer Reports says its survey of subscribers, representing 330,000 vehicles, took place last spring and summer. It asked owners of vehicles from the 2000 through 2023 model years, with a smattering of 2024 models, about problems they had experienced in the previous 12 months."

The U.S. has reached a crucial milestone in its efforts to electrify: More than 1 million new EVs have been sold here this year, according to Motorintelligence.com. The auto industry consulting firm says EVs accounted for 7.5% of total U.S. sales through November. Experts say that number must rise swiftly to address climate change because a large share of greenhouse gases comes from transport. Ford Motor Co. recently touted a 43% increase in electric vehicle sales year over year — which includes its top-selling electric Mustang Mach E SUV, as well as the F-150 Lightning pickup — in a November sales release. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 and the Kia EV6, both electric SUVs, each hit around 100% growth year over year last month. Despite these positives, this doesn’t come close to the 90% year over year growth the EV industry enjoyed last summer. EVs had huge sales growth at the time, even with models averaging more than $65,000, according to Cox Automotive data. Demand was high, inventories were low, and automakers were bullish on sales prospects. This is largely because EVs were more appealing to buyers as gasoline prices flirted with $5 per gallon, said Kevin Roberts, director of industry analytics at the CarGurus website. Now, gasoline has dropped to around $3 per gallon nationwide, and the average transaction price for an EV, without any incentives applied, has fallen to just under $52,000. Many tech-savvy early adopters have already bought EVs, and the market has moved to more price-sensitive mainstream buyers, many of whom don’t want to pay more for an EV than they would for a gasoline or hybrid vehicle, Roberts said. A number of other factors are souring today’s positive momentum. Until recently, there were few EV models available to choose from. Location, cost, and convenience of charging these cars also remains a concern, as does vehicle range. Although there is interest in EVs, Richard Bazzy, who owns three Ford dealerships in suburban Pittsburgh, said many customers tell his sales staff that they’re just not ready yet to make the transition to battery power given the pricing, even with federal tax credits. Customers also fear the electric range isn’t long enough to travel where they want to go. This is true especially for those with harsh winters, where range can deplete more quickly. He also said they’re concerned about too few charging stations. “Interest is there because it’s intriguing,” Bazzy said. “But it just doesn’t overcome the concerns.” As such, the sales pace slowed to 50% year over year by June 2023, and last month, it dropped to 35% year over year. Some automakers are reevaluating their costly EV strategies as the year comes to a close. Ford has sold just under 36,000 Mach Es through November, only a 3.5% increase over the same period last year. The company’s inventory of Mach Es has been growing much of the year. It had more than 24,000 at or en route to dealers at the end of last month, even though it has been cutting production for the past two months. Yet, Lightning pickup sales of 20,365 are up almost 54%. “We have to manage supply with demand,” said Erich Merkle, Ford’s head of U.S. sales analysis. “We would do that with any product in our portfolio.” Ford recently announced plans to delay one new EV battery plant, shrink the size of another, and postpone $12 billion worth of future electric vehicle spending. GM also delayed retooling an EV plant, and Volkswagen has delayed plans in Europe. “Every automaker was so aggressive with their plans,” Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights, said. “We’re seeing those being dialed back to better match where consumers are right now.” General Motors CEO Mary Barra remains committed to the company’s targets, so long as consumer interest is there. “We still have a plan in place that allows us to be all light-duty vehicles EV by 2035,” Barra said in an Automotive Press Association event on December 4. “We’ll adjust based on where the customer is and where demand is. It’s not going to be, if we build it they will come. We’re going to be led by the customer.” Many of these companies’ auto dealers are now raising alarm about what they see as slowing EV interest. Last week, several thousand dealers from across the country wrote in a public letter to President Joe Biden their concerns over the shift to EVs, calling electrification mandates “unrealistic based on current and forecasted customer demand. Already, electric vehicles are stacking up on our lots.” The Biden Administration targeted half of all new vehicle sales in the nation to be electric by 2030 in August 2021 as part of its efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions, much of which come from transportation sector carbon dioxide emissions, a result of burning fossil fuels such as petroleum. Transportation is a major contributor of GHG emissions, particularly personal transport. “The short answer is yes, people are resisting” the switch to electric vehicles, Bazzy said. The environmental group Sierra Club and others have said that many dealers don’t make an effort to sell them. Key metrics related to how long it takes for a vehicle to sell once it is at a dealership, known as days-to-turn, as well as how much inventory of certain types of vehicles is available at dealerships, are being used to assess current US EV demand. While internal combustion engine cars and hybrid electric vehicles saw 40 and 17 days-to-turn, respectively, in October, the figure for electric vehicles was 57, according to data from car-shopping resource Edmunds. A year ago, EVs took 39 days to turn, while hybrid EVs took 12 and combustion engine vehicles, 26. This indicates EVs are starting to take longer to sell, on average. Auto manufacturers have been boosting their incentives on EVs, in an effort to bring the cost of these vehicles down. As of October, EVs were still nearly $4,000 more, on average, than gasoline cars. Incentives reached 9.8% of the average transaction price of EVs in September, according to Cox. Before the pandemic, industry incentives like this were commonplace. During the peak of COVID, incentives hit record lows as supply dwindled. Now, incentives are recovering slightly, but the industry average was at just 4.9% this fall, indicating the extent of today’s EV discounts. But many EV proponents believe today’s roadblocks are temporary, and the larger challenges are being addressed with a variety of solutions. “The rhetoric has been that there are challenges in the market,” said Ben Prochazka, executive director of the Electrification Coalition. “The reality is we’re continuing to see strong sales, strong growth. “There are still things that we need to do and that need to move faster,” he added. “So I don’t know if I would call it a pullback. There’s a lot of opportunity to continue to do more to help build consumer interest and confidence in this shift.”"

But a new study finds their vehicles actually make the air dirtier, worsening global warming. Ethanol isn’t so green, either. “It’s kind of hard to beat gasoline” for public and environmental health, said study co-author Julian Marshall, an engineering professor at the University of Minnesota. “A lot of the technologies that we think of as being clean ... are not better than gasoline.” The key is where the source of the electricity all-electric cars. If it comes from coal, the electric cars produce 3.6 times more soot and smog deaths than gas, because of the pollution made in generating the electricity, according to the study that is published Monday by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They also are significantly worse at heat-trapping carbon dioxide that worsens global warming, it found. The study examines environmental costs for cars’ entire life cycle, including where power comes from and the environmental effects of building batteries. “Unfortunately, when a wire is connected to an electric vehicle at one end and a coal-fired power plant at the other end, the environmental consequences are worse than driving a normal gasoline-powered car,” said Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science, who wasn’t part of the study but praised it. The states with the highest percentage of electricity coming from coal, according to the Department of Energy, are West Virginia, Wyoming, Ohio, North Dakota, and Illinois. Still, there’s something to be said for the idea of helping foster a cleaner technology that will be better once it is connected to a cleaner grid, said study co-author Jason Hill, another University of Minnesota engineering professor. The study finds all-electric vehicles cause 86 percent more deaths from air pollution than do cars powered by regular gasoline. Coal produces 39 percent of the country’s electricity, according to the Department of Energy. But if the power supply comes from natural gas, the all-electric car produces half as many air pollution health problems as gas-powered cars do. And if the power comes from wind, water or wave energy, it produces about one-quarter of the air pollution deaths. Hybrids and diesel engines are cleaner than gas, causing fewer air pollution deaths and spewing less heat-trapping gas. But ethanol isn’t, with 80 percent more air pollution mortality, according to the study. “If we’re using ethanol for environmental benefits, for air quality and climate change, we’re going down the wrong path,” Hill said."

OLSEN and KARL RITTER,10/12/2023,"A ban on gasoline and diesel-fueled cars from a commercial district of Stockholm’s downtown in 2025 will be the first for a European capital, a city official said Thursday. The ban will take effect in a 20-block area of shops, pedestrian walkways and a few homes in order to curb pollution, reduce noise and encourage use of electric vehicles said Lars Strömgren, the city council member for the Greens who’s in charge of the Swedish capital’s transportation. Many European capitals have restrictions on gasoline and diesel cars, but Strömgren says Stockholm’s complete ban would be a first. “We need to eliminate the harmful exhaust gases from (gasoline) and diesel cars. That’s why we are introducing the most ambitious low-emission zone to date,” Strömgren told The Associated Press. The idea is to create an “environmental zone” where only electric vehicles will be allowed. There will be some exceptions such as for emergency vehicles and transportation for the disabled. In its budget for 2024, the left-leaning, environmentally-focused city council on Tuesday unveiled the plan for the target area just north of the city’s famed Old Town. The municipal government controls a majority in the council, so the vote set for Nov. 23 is expected to be a formality. “We are pretty proud, I must say,” Strömgren said, adding that gradual expansion of the environmental zone would be decided in the first half of 2025. One of the city’s main cab companies, Taxi Stockholm, said its transition to emission-free vehicles is moving at a fast pace. The company’s acting chief executive Pernilla Samuelsson said it’s emission-free vehicles now make up 30% of its fleet - almost seven times more than last year. “In other words, the transition is going fast and it is already being driven forward by the industry,” Samuelson said. Some aren’t convinced things will go smoothly. Nike Örbrink from the opposition Christian Democrats told the Aftonbladet newspaper that some are concerned the plan would hurt businesses and the hotel industry. Other European capitals harbor similar ambitions. The Dutch capital, Amsterdam, is aiming for all transport in the city, including automobiles, to be emissions-free by 2030. The mayor of Paris wanted to ban all diesel cars before next year’s Olympics, and gasoline cars by 2030, but has run up against resistance. Currently, any diesel cars built before 2006 and gasoline cars built before 1997 are banned in Paris and 77 surrounding towns for 12 hours a day on weekdays. The ban will expand in 2025 for diesel cars built before 2011 and pre-2006 gasoline vehicles."

A rule proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency would require that up to two-thirds of new vehicles sold in the U.S. are electric by 2032, a nearly tenfold increase over current EV sales. The proposed regulation, announced in April, would set tailpipe emissions limits for the 2027 through 2032 model years that are the strictest ever imposed — and call for far more new EV sales than the auto industry agreed to less than two years ago. The EPA says it is not imposing an EV mandate, but Republicans say the plan favors EVs and punishes gas engines, forcing Americans into cars and trucks they can’t afford. “Americans should have the right to decide what products and appliances work best for their family, not the federal government,’' said Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., the bill’s chief sponsor. The proposed EPA regulation would drive up costs for motorists “and hand the keys of America’s auto industry to China,” Walberg said, referring to that country’s dominance over the EV battery supply chain. The measure was approved 221-197 and now goes to the Senate, where it is unlikely to advance. Five Democrats — Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas; Don Davis of North Carolina; Jared Golden of Maine; and Mary Peltola of Alaska — voted with Republicans to block the EPA rule. New EVs typically cost more than gas-powered cars, although prices have declined in recent months as supplies have increased and tax credits for EV purchases approved in the 2022 climate law have taken effect. EVs also have lower operating costs because they don’t require gasoline. The average transaction price for EVs was $53,469 in July, compared with $48,334 for gas-powered cars, according to Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research company. Tesla contributed to a substantial drop in EV prices since late last year as it cut prices, the research company said. The White House strongly opposes the GOP bill and said in a statement that President Joe Biden would veto the measure if it reaches his desk. The bill would “catastrophically impair EPA’s ability to issue automotive regulations that protect public health, save consumers money, strengthen American energy security and protect American investments in the vehicle technologies of the future,’' the White House said in a statement. EPA’s proposed standards for passenger cars and light trucks are performance-based, the White House said, and allow vehicle manufacturers to choose the mix of technologies best suited for their customers. More than 100 EV models are now available in the U.S. alongside hybrid and gas-powered options, “giving Americans unprecedented flexibility in where and how they choose to fuel,’' the White House said. The EPA proposal could save Americans thousands of dollars over a vehicle’s lifetime by accelerating adoption of technologies that reduce fuel and maintenance costs along with pollution, the White House said. The GOP bill “would undermine all of these benefits, harming American consumers, companies and workers,’' the White House said. Republicans said the EPA rule would reduce choices for car owners, “shipping our auto-future and jobs to China” in the process. “President Biden’s rush to green agenda is failing,’' Rodgers said. “He wants us all driving EVs — 100% battery electric, not plug-in, not hybrid. We don’t agree.” New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the energy panel, said the GOP bill would stifle innovation and cause uncertainty for American automakers. The bill includes “vague language” that could prevent EPA from ever finalizing vehicle standards for any type of motor vehicle, Pallone said. Instead of working with Democrats on legislation to lower costs for consumers or protect public health, “the Republican majority is, once again, bringing an anti-clean vehicle bill to the floor as part of their polluters over people agenda,’' Pallone said during floor debate. “This bill would simply prevent the EPA from doing its job,’' Pallone said, accusing House Republicans of “trying to legislate away years of innovation in clean transportation.’'"

The move comes a day after Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont withdrew proposed regulations mirroring California’s clean vehicle standards after it became apparent there wasn’t enough support on a key legislative committee. Those standards would have halted sales of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. House Speaker Matt Ritter, a Democrat from Hartford, said that his members plan to meet on Monday to discuss possible legislation that addresses concerns about the regulations. Republicans and others say they’re worried about the high cost of electric vehicles, the availability of charging stations and the ability of the state’s electric grid to handle the anticipated changeover from gas-combustion engines to electric vehicles. “We have to do more,” said Ritter. “We have to demonstrate to Connecticut residents that this switch will not only save the environment, save lives, and save our planet — but not leave you in a position where you can no longer afford a vehicle.” Lamont’s decision to withdraw the proposed regulations, a week after New Jersey became the latest state to announce plans to prohibit the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, was seen as a setback by some advocates. Members of the public booed when the withdrawal was announced during Tuesday’s meeting of the General Assembly’s Regulations Review Committee. A growing number of states are committing to California’s aggressive plan to move toward zero-emission vehicles, including Vermont, New York, Washington, Oregon, Massachusetts, Virginia, Rhode Island and Maryland, according to Coltura, a Seattle-based nonprofit advocating for an end to gasoline vehicle use. “Unfortunately, a misinformation campaign fueled by the fossil fuel industry won and Connecticut residents will pay the price,” said Ruth Canovi, director of advocacy with the American Lung Association in Connecticut, in a written statement. She said Connecticut “is now positioned to be the only clean car state from Virginia to Vermont to leave our residents out of these strong public health, climate change, and health equity policies this year.” State Rep. Vincent Candelora, the Republican leader of the Connecticut House of Representatives, said he was pleased Lamont decided to withdraw the regulations. “I’m hoping that this next look will take into consideration the affordability and the impact it’s going to have on residents, especially people that live in the cities,” he said. “So we really need a broader conversation, looking at the electric grid and the feasibility of being able to do something like this.” The new legislative session begins Feb. 7. “It seems that we do have an opportunity for a compromise on this and to keep moving in the right direction that we need to move on,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, a Democrat. “So we need to hold on to that when we get to the next legislative session and, as expected, will take this up.” Moving forward, Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes said Connecticut will either “default to the EPA standard or we will move forward with the California program.” Under the California program, the state must give auto manufacturers advance notice of when it plans to implement the tougher standards. In order to implement California’s standards for the 2027 model year, Connecticut would have to adopt the regulations by the end of 2023. If regulations are adopted in 2024, they’d impact the 2028 model year. In April, the Biden administration proposed new automobile pollution limits that would require up to two-thirds of new vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2032, a nearly tenfold increase over current electric vehicle sales."

That could risk climate goals,DAVID McHUGH,10/17/2023,"Stalled spending on electrical grids worldwide is slowing the rollout of renewable energy and could put efforts to limit climate change at risk if millions of miles of power lines are not added or refurbished in the next few years, the International Energy Agency said. The Paris-based organization said in the report Tuesday that the capacity to connect to and transmit electricity is not keeping pace with the rapid growth of clean energy technologies such as solar and wind power, electric cars and heat pumps being deployed to move away from fossil fuels. IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol told The Associated Press in an interview that there is a long line of renewable projects waiting for the green light to connect to the grid. The stalled projects could generate 1,500 gigawatts of power, or five times the amount of solar and wind capacity that was added worldwide last year, he said. “It’s like you are manufacturing a very efficient, very speedy, very handsome car — but you forget to build the roads for it,” Birol said. If spending on grids stayed at current levels, the chance of holding the global increase in average temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — the goal set by the 2015 Paris climate accords — “is going to be diminished substantially,” he said. The IEA assessment of electricity grids around the globe found that achieving the climate goals set by the world’s governments would require adding or refurbishing 80 million kilometers (50 million miles) of power lines by 2040 — an amount equal to the existing global grid in less than two decades. Annual investment has been stagnant but needs to double to more than $600 billion a year by 2030, the agency said. It’s not uncommon for a single high-voltage overhead power line to take five to 13 years to get approved through bureaucracy in advanced economies, while lead times are significantly shorter in China and India, according to the IEA. The report cited the South Link transmission project to carry wind power from northern to southern Germany. First planned in 2014, it was delayed after political opposition to an overhead line meant it was buried instead. Completion is expected in 2028 instead of 2022. Other important projects that have been held up: the 400-kilometer (250-mile) Bay of Biscay connector between Spain and France, now expected for 2028 instead of 2025, and the SunZia high-voltage line to bring wind power from New Mexico to Arizona and California. Construction started only last month after years of delays. On the East Coast, the Avangrid line to bring hydropower from Canada to New England was interrupted in 2021 following a referendum in Maine. A court overturned the statewide vote rejecting the project in April."

Proposed state regulations would require auto dealerships in Connecticut to begin progressively selling more zero- or low-emission vehicles, including passenger cars, SUVs and light trucks, in 2027 and through 2035, until the new mandate would begin. The regulations also require increasing percentages of electric medium and heavy-duty electric vehicles, such as dump trucks, sold in the state by 2032, depending on the vehicle class. The concept was part of a wide-ranging law passed in 2022 that adopted California’s clean air standards for certain trucks in an effort to reduce vehicle emissions. California air regulators adopted regulations last summer to have all new cars, pickup trucks and SUVs be electric or hydrogen by 2035. “I think we’re doing it smart,” Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said at a news conference held this week at a Toyota dealership. He said he’s spoken with the “auto guys” about the proposed 2035 deadline and asked if Connecticut was moving too fast. “They say, ‘keep your pedal to the metal’” and by that I mean “make sure we have a clear idea that Connecticut is not alone, it’s going to be one of the states where it’s all electric (in) 2023. That makes it easier for us to design and build (vehicles),’” Lamont said. Connecticut joins Rhode Island, Maryland, New Jersey and New Mexico in announcing plans to adopt the new standards. Massachusetts, New York and Vermont finalized adoption of the rules this year or in late 2022. The Connecticut Department Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner is accepting public comment on the proposed regulations until Aug. 23. DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said she expects they will be ready for legislative approval by the end of year. The regulations would only apply to vehicle manufacturers and would not affect used gas-powered cars, which would still be allowed to be driven in Connecticut. "

Plans outlined by the departments of Treasury and Energy would limit EV buyers from claiming the full tax credit if they purchase cars containing battery materials from China and other countries that are considered hostile to the United States. The new rules, required under Biden’s signature climate law approved last year, are likely to slow consumer acceptance of electric vehicles just as Biden is trying to ramp up sales to help meet his goal to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. EV sales have tripled since Biden took office, but the U.S. still depends on foreign sources, especially China, for many of critical minerals needed to produce EV batteries. It’s still not clear which vehicles would be eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit under the new plan because the Biden administration has yet to publish any lists. Congress included language in the Inflation Reduction Act that bars electric cars from qualifying for the full tax break if critical minerals or other battery components were made by a “foreign entity of concern.” The law defines that as any company that is owned by, controlled by or subject to the jurisdiction of North Korea, China, Russia or Iran, although the main target is China. Administration officials said the auto industry has long been aware of the pending rules and has taken steps to develop auto-supply chains in the U.S and distance the industry from China, which has long dominated production and processing of minerals such as lithium and graphite used in EV batteries. The White House hopes the new tax credit rules will encourage development of auto-supply chains in the U.S. “Automakers have already adjusted the supply chain to ensure buyers are eligible for these credits and are continuing to do so,’' Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told reporters this week. “These changes take time, but companies are making the investments and Americans are buying these cars.’' Spurred by the climate law, carmakers such as General Motors and Hyundai, are racing to build U.S. factories to produce batteries and process materials like lithium. But they are still years away from being able to produce an electric vehicle without materials and components from China. Adeyemo and other officials said the rules are intended to provide clarity following months of uncertainty over how strictly the administration would interpret rules on foreign entities of concern, sometimes referred to as FEOC. “Clarity is exactly what we’re after with manufacturers in particular as they make major investments in EVs that are vital for the future growth of this important industry,’' Deputy Energy Secretary David Turk said. Asked how many cars that now qualify for tax credits will lose some or all of the credit next year, Adeyemo said the auto companies themselves “will determine which ones qualify” by their actions. “These are sophisticated players,’' Turk added, referring to the auto industry. Ford, GM and other U.S. companies ”are moving already’’ to boost U.S. supplies of batteries and critical minerals and will move further to comply in coming months, Turk said. John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing major automakers, said the transition to EVs “requires nothing short of a complete transformation of the U.S. industrial base. It’s a monumental task that won’t happen overnight.’' The Treasury Department’s guidance “recognizes the complexity of this task and the challenges facing automakers with some good balance. Day one verdict: Clarity for automakers. Finally,’' he said in a statement Friday. Sam Abuelsamid, a mobility analyst for Guidehouse Insights, expects many EVs now eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit will see that cut in half next year when the new regulations take effect. Automakers can probably comply with a requirement that 60% of battery parts come from North America next year to qualify for a $3,750 tax credit, he said. But it will be much harder for them to get batteries with half their critical minerals from the U.S. or countries with which it has a free trade agreement, and it’s likely they’ll lose $3,750 of the credit. Beginning in 2024, an eligible clean vehicle may not contain any battery components that are manufactured by a foreign entity of concern, the Treasury Department said. Beginning in 2025 clean vehicle must not contain any critical minerals that were extracted, processed, or recycled by a foreign entity of concern in order to qualify for a tax credit. As a result, 2024 and 2025 are likely to be tough years for automakers to meet the battery content requirements, Abuelsamid and other analysts said. China is currently responsible for about three-quarters of the world’s cathode and lithium-ion battery cell production, and more than 90% of anode production. To allow for credits to continue while the rulemaking process proceeds, the proposed rules would provide a transition period for EVs placed in service after Jan. 1, Treasury said. While smaller tax credits and high interest rates could hurt EV sales, a new rule allowing tax credits to be applied at the time of sale might offset those problems, Abuelsamid said. Getting the tax credit upfront, rather than waiting until filing tax returns next year, “will actually reduce your monthly payment, which is a major stumbling block for consumers,” he said. Customers also can lease an EV and get the full tax credit since they are classified under the law as commercial vehicles exempt from the North America manufacturing and battery-content requirements. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said the new rules don’t go far enough to prevent Chinese-made batteries from receiving U.S. tax breaks. Manchin, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, was a key author of the provision barring the full tax credit if battery components are manufactured or assembled by a political adversary such as China. He slammed the new rules as an “unlawful” attempt to bypass the climate law’s made-in-America provisions. “I do not understand why President Biden is allowing his administration to now route our essential supply chains through China,’' Manchin said, adding that he would move to overturn the battery rules through the Congressional Review Act if the regulations are not revised. A spokesman for the National Mining Association welcomed the new rules as “an important step forward’’ to address China’s dominance of EV supply chains, but said more needs to be done to build secure and reliable mineral supply chains in the U.S. “We simply need vastly more domestic mining and processing. We can’t catalyze secure, responsible supply chains if we don’t approve domestic mines,’' spokesman Conor Bernstein said. The complexity of the rules is shown by controversy over Ford Motor Co.'s plans to build a factory in Michigan that would employ about 1,700 people to make batteries for new and existing EVs. Ford says a wholly owned subsidiary would own the factory and employ the workers. But China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, or CATL, which is known for its lithium-iron-phosphate expertise, would supply technology, some equipment and workers. Administration officials declined to say whether batteries from the Ford plant would qualify for tax credits."

Michelle Lujan Grisham signed an executive order Monday directing state agencies to switch to an all-electric vehicle fleet within the next 12 years. Lujan Grisham also said she intends to pursue tax credits for electric vehicles during the upcoming legislative session. The Democratic governor made the announcement Monday during her Symposium on the Future of Transportation in New Mexico. “The fact of the matter is that consumers and dealers want better access to electric vehicles, and the actions we’ve taken through Clean Car rules and now tax credits are leveling the playing field,” Lujan Grisham said. “I also took action today to make sure the state is ‘walking the walk’ when it comes to widely adopting low- and zero-emission vehicles by requiring the state fleet to be zero-emission by 2035.” The proposed tax credits would apply to new and used electric vehicles to help meet climate goals. Lujan Grisham’s order directs departments to purchase zero-emission vehicles for all new acquisitions where one or more options are available. Exceptions to the order include law enforcement vehicles, firefighting trucks and some other heavy-duty vehicles."
https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/fear-cheap-chinese-evs-spurs-automaker-dash-affordable-cars-2023-12-08/,Reuters,middle,Fear of cheap Chinese EVs spurs automaker dash for affordable cars,Nick Carey and Paul Lienert,12/8/2023,"The rise of inexpensive Chinese electric vehicles has upped the pressure on legacy automakers who have turned to suppliers, from battery materials makers to chipmakers, to squeeze out costs and develop affordable EVs quicker than previously planned. ""Automakers are really now only turning to affordable vehicles, knowing they've got to or they will lose out to Chinese manufacturers,"" said Andy Palmer, chairman of UK startup Brill Power, which has developed hardware and software to boost EV battery management system performance. Palmer, formerly Aston Martin's CEO, said Brill Power's products could boost EV range by 60% and enable smaller batteries. The battery is an EV's most costly component. Fears of slowing demand because EVs are expensive has increased urgency to reduce costs. That urgency can be seen everywhere. Renault (RENA.PA) said last month it plans 40% cost reductions for its EVs to reach price parity with fossil-fuel models. Stellantis (STLAM.MI) is building a European plant with China's CATL (300750.SZ) to make cheaper LFP batteries and recently unveiled the Citroen electric e-C3 SUV, which starts at 23,300 euros ($24,540). Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Tesla (TSLA.O) are developing 25,000-euro EVs. Vincent Pluvinage, CEO of Palo Alto, California-based OneD Battery Sciences, said that on his recent visits with European automaker customers, every meeting started with the same refrain: ""'Reducing costs is now more important than anything else.'"" OneD adds silicon nanowires to graphite EV battery anode material to boost range and cut charging time, saving $281 - nearly 50% - versus using graphite alone for a 100 kilowatt hour (kWh) EV battery. This can reduce EV battery weight by 20% for the same range, Pluvinage said. General Motors (GM.N) is a OneD investor and customer. OneD has developed a manufacturing process on relatively inexpensive machinery used in the solar panel industry, as Pluvinage said automakers dislike complex, costly new processes. OneD's first test plant will open early next year. Hodenhagen, Germany-based Veekim has developed an EV motor with magnets using a form of ferrite, or iron powder, instead of rare earths, which five automakers and suppliers are testing for affordable EV projects. Legacy automakers want to cut rare earths use because China dominates mining and processing. Veekim CEO Peter Siegle said using cheaper ferrite and low-cost processes - including 3D-printed copper wiring - can cut an EV motor's price by 20%. Motors can cost more than 500 euros. 'ALL ABOUT THE COST' It is not just startups seeking EV cost reductions. Chip maker NXP (NXPI.O) is working with automakers to reduce the amount of electronic control units - or mini-computers - in EVs, which can number between 200 and 300, said Allan McAuslin, director of vehicle control and electrification. Siemens (SIEGn.DE) has developed software simulation called digital twins to halve expensive EV development time. European automakers are reacting to the arrival of lower-cost EVs from China, whose makers are planning even cheaper models. BYD's (002594.SZ) Dolphin hatchback, for instance, starts in the UK at 26,000 pounds ($33,000), nearly 30% below the starting price for the VW ID.3 hatchback. But U.S. automakers, somewhat protected from Chinese EV imports by subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act, also seek more affordable EVs. GM said it has saved billions partly by developing a more inexpensive battery pack with LFP batteries for its revamped Bolt EV, which will launch in 2025, two years earlier than planned. Ford (F.N) said it will cut costs partly through a 50% increase in ""in-sourcing"" of parts like batteries and inverters. Premium automakers want lower costs for EVs, too. Michigan-based Our Next Energy (ONE) is developing an ""Ares"" battery pack with cheaper LFP technology that should give automakers the same electric driving range for half the price and a ""Gemini"" pack for customers including BMW (BMWG.DE) that offers extended range and should cost $75/kWh compared with an average today of $130/kWh, CEO Mujeeb Ijaz said. Suppliers said automakers particularly like less expensive parts that also reduce production costs. San Carlos, California-based CelLink has developed a laminate sheet to replace wire harnesses - labor-intensive to make and install - that can be installed by robots. CelLink raised $250 million from investors last year and in May announced a $362 million U.S. government loan for its Texas factory. Since opening that plant, said CEO Kevin Coakley, ""We've gotten some form of a purchase order from basically every major automaker that's come through there."" Israeli startup Addionics has developed porous, three-dimensional copper and aluminium electrode battery materials that look like sheer silk scarves when held up to the light and use far less material - including 60% less copper. Those electrodes provide faster charging and boost EV range by 30%, CEO Moshiel Biton said. But automakers are more interested in projected savings of up to $7.50 per kWh. ""What we hear from carmakers today is, 'We don't need longer range, we want lower costs,'"" Biton said."

After years of accelerating growth, Europe's electric car sales appear to be entering a go-slow zone as consumers wait for better and cheaper models and interest rates remain high. ACC, a joint venture between Stellantis (STLAM.MI), TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) and Mercedes-Benz Group (MBGn.DE), has plans for three gigafactories in Europe. It has already inaugurated one in France. One will follow in Germany, followed by another in Italy. ACC plans to start production at the first module of its Italian gigafactory in Termoli at the end of 2026, the FIM, FIOM, UILM, Fismic, UglM and AqcfR metalworker unions said. ""The second and third modules are scheduled to start operations in 2027, but the exact timing may be influenced by that of the more general transition to electric (mobility),"" unions said in a joint statement after the meeting at Italy's Industry Ministry. ACC was not immediately available for comment. According to the unions, ACC confirmed on Monday the Italian gigafactory, which has an overall investment of over 2 billion euros ($2.16 billion), would employ 1,800 people by end-2029, as initially planned."
https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eus-electric-dreams-short-circuited-by-ev-charging-gridlock-2023-12-04/,Reuters,middle,EV charging growth plans slowed by EU's power grid problems,Julia Payne,12/4/2023,"Electric vehicle drivers hoping to top up their batteries at one of Repsol's (REP.MC) 1,600 Spanish charging stations might well be disappointed, with nearly half lying dormant because they have no power connection. Such gaps are evident across the European Union, where last week the European Commission announced plans to upgrade the bloc's power grids. These are due to be implemented in 18 months and include addressing EV charging station power shortages. But despite the declarations of its leaders, red tape preventing progress towards greener transport in the EU is on the rise, industry groups and energy companies told Reuters, with permitting one of the major roadblocks. The ease of building an EV charging hub varies considerably country by country. One industry source said that in Germany a hub was held up for months over rules protecting a single tree, while another located on a busy highway had to wait 10 months for a noise evaluation before it gained approval. ""Although the work of installing a fast and ultra-fast charging point requires only two to three weeks of work, due to different administrative requirements in Spain, the complete process ... can last from one to two years,"" Repsol said. Industry group ChargeUp Europe said that while the Commission recognised permitting was a problem, it had not proposed any concrete tools or actions. Specific guidelines for member states to accelerate permitting are only expected at some point over the next two years, the plan's timeline shows. This is slowing down the rollout of charging hubs across the 27-member bloc, putting EU targets to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles, as well as its broader climate goals, in peril. ""The time needed for connecting the EV recharging points to the grid can indeed be seen as a barrier to accelerate the uptake of EVs and needs to be tackled,"" a Commission spokesperson said in an emailed response. The process for setting up a fast EV station has risen to an average of two years from six months in the last few years, four EV charging companies and the industry's representative said, as firms wade through myriad rules from federal to municipal level. ""It's Kafka meets the energy transition. We have so many things working against Europe but we could fix this,"" Lucie Mattera, secretary general of ChargeUp Europe, told Reuters. Mattera said the number of EVs will grow faster than the total number of public charging stations which ChargeUp Europe estimates will rise by nine times by 2030, with EVs by ten. The electrification of transport is one of the key pillars underpinning the EU's goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. To do so, it will ban sales of CO2-emitting vehicles from 2035 and wants to develop a network of EV charging stations. That ambition has created bottlenecks for power companies and regulators unprepared for the surge in demand in the EU, where so far only 5.4% of passenger cars run on alternative fuels, including electric, out of a total 286 million. ""It's up to the member states now to really step up,"" Miguel Stilwell de Andrade, CEO of Portuguese energy firm EDP, said, adding: ""There's just an avalanche of projects"". GRIDLOCK This year, the EU adopted a law to install fast chargers by 2030 every 60 kilometres along designated road networks for passenger cars and every 100 km for heavy-duty vehicles. But charging developers say obtaining basic data about potential hubs is a major challenge, making investments hard. This involves finding out whether an average roadside rest stop has a single lamppost or enough cabling that connects to the broader grid. Hubs often require an extra electricity sub-station, which converts high voltage power into smaller units. The process then involves requests to power distribution companies (DSOs) to install more capacity. ""Sometimes we have to send physical mail,"" said Peter Badik, co-founder of EV charging firm Greenway Network, which has set up 1,300 EV chargers in Slovakia, Croatia and Poland. ""Even when they say yes, you don't know when they will do the upgrade,"" Batik said, adding there was so far no way to track how quickly a power company was building up capacity. Industry executives said the EU targets were set low and were therefore likely to be met, but might not meet demand for the growing EV fleet of cars and especially trucks. There is a strong industry impetus to build hubs for electric cars, but not yet for long-haul trucks and buses. These account for more than 25% of greenhouse gas emissions from EU road transport, which as a whole is responsible for a fifth of the bloc's emissions. BP, which expects to roll out more than 100,000 car and truck charging stations globally by 2030, said that in Germany alone, it has to deal with around 800 grid companies to set up fast hubs for both cars and trucks. ""Many have individual requirements which can significantly hinder progress,"" Stefan van Dobschuetz, vice president of BP Pulse Europe, said, adding that was before other types of permits concerning noise and archaeology are applied for. ""There is a clear need for more standardisation (of requirements for charging hubs),"" BP's van Dobschuetz added. That call was echoed by ChargeUp Europe's Mattera who said guidelines from the Commission would likely help EU members align as the rate of new projects varies across the region."
https://www.reuters.com/world/us/2024-republican-ev-attacks-may-fall-short-swing-states-reap-investment-2023-11-27/,Reuters,middle,"In 2024, Republican EV attacks may fall short as swing states reap investment",Gram Slattery and Nichola Groom,11/27/2023,"Electric vehicles are a ""hoax,"" they do not work, and they are strengthening China's economy at the expense of American jobs. Those are among the criticisms that contenders for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, including former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, have leveled on the campaign trail in recent weeks. But while EVs have emerged as a common foe for Republicans seeking the country's top job, they are increasingly a source of tax revenue and employment in the states that will determine the winner of the 2024 presidential election. That has created a potential opportunity that President Joe Biden and some Democratic congressional candidates are seeking to exploit to win support before next November's vote, according to 25 Democratic and Republican strategists, local officials, labor leaders and a review of campaign literature. There have been roughly $128 billion in investments in domestic EV and battery manufacturing announced since the 2022 passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA. That law, supported by Biden and congressional Democrats, created tax credits to boost domestic EV manufacturing. Of that investment, $48 billion - or one third - has taken place in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Michigan, according to an analysis done by advocacy group Climate Power at Reuters' request. Those four states, along with Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, are the arguably the most competitive in the country. In those seven states combined, Trump holds a 41% to 35% lead over Biden, meaning the race is extremely tight when the credibility interval is considered, according to a September Reuters/Ipsos poll. About 24% of respondents said they were not sure how they would vote or planned to vote for someone else. Other surveys have indicated a dead heat in some of those states, meaning both Democrats and Republicans will be attuned to any angle that could give them even a slight advantage. Mike Morey, a partner at public affairs and political consulting firm SKDK, said EV investments promoted by the Biden administration could make a significant difference. ""It's pretty hard to ignore. We're talking about billions of dollars (in investments),"" he said. The key for Democrats, he said, will be focusing on how Democratic legislation has created jobs, not on EVs themselves. ""You just need to sell jobs to independents and the rest of the country,"" he said. ""The point is that they're manufacturing jobs, whether they be baskets or batteries."" Trump leads the race for the Republican 2024 nomination by a wide margin. Biden has touted the IRA in recent television ads and has visited a pair of manufacturing facilities since August that build EVs and charging stations. Clean Energy for America, an advocacy group close to Democrats, is running ads in Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina featuring workers talking about the benefits of the IRA, said its executive director, Andrew Reagan. Kirsten Engel, a Democratic candidate in a sun-baked southern Arizona district laced with EV facilities, said she planned to frequently discuss how Democratic legislation has attracted EV jobs to the region, and that it had already come up in initial conversations with voters. ""It's a top issue in the campaign,"" she said. ""BIG BLUE PLASMA BEAM"" Since 2015, EV and battery supply chain investments in America have topped $165 billion, most of it occurring in the first year of the IRA, according to the Environmental Defense Fund and consulting firm WSP. The IRA affords a tax credit to purchasers of EVs assembled in North America, while also incentivizing clean energy projects, like solar and wind farms - part of the Biden administration's broader strategy to fight climate change. Cheap land, low power prices, local tax incentives and solid infrastructure lured many of these projects to states that, out of happenstance, are political battlegrounds. More recently, high interest rates have dampened demand for EVs, prompting some manufacturers to scale back expansion plans. But domestic EV sales remain relatively strong, topping 300,000 units for the first time in the third quarter. EVs are expected to make up nearly 50% of car sales in America by 2030, according to an analysis by the non-profit RMI. In some communities where EV manufacturing has made an impact, it can be difficult to find a Republican who speaks ill of the industry's local growth, even if they are wary of the underlying technology. ""I don't know if I'll go around on a lithium battery, so if I'm in a wreck I burn in a big blue plasma beam,"" said Jesse Williams, the head of the Republican Party in Decatur County, Georgia. Still, he supports an $800 million EV battery plant under construction in his community - and has no problem with tax credits that help bring the plant to what he describes as a ""low-income"" area. On the presidential campaign trail, Republicans have struck a different tone. They have made clear they see IRA subsidies as government overreach, while expressing concern that minerals vital for EV manufacturing, like graphite and manganese, often originate in China. Trump and other Republicans, who tend to back traditional energy sources like oil and coal along with gasoline-powered cars and trucks, have also appealed to the anxieties of the United Auto Workers union. Many UAW members are wary of EVs as they require less labor to assemble than combustion engine vehicles. While the UAW is strong in Michigan, the union is weaker in the South and Southwest. ""Joe Biden's electric vehicle obsession helps China, hurts American consumers and families, and is a pathetic non-solution to skyrocketing gas prices under his watch,"" said Anna Kelly, press secretary for the Republican National Committee. A Trump spokesperson pointed Reuters to a recent policy announcement in which the former president said EV manufacturing would harm workers. ""What's happening to our auto workers is an absolute disgrace and an outrage beyond belief,"" Trump said. The DeSantis campaign did not respond to a request for comment, though he has been consistently critical of EVs. ""Why would you want to knowingly make this country more dependent on what goes on in China?"" DeSantis said in July. Biden's campaign pointed Reuters to a statement from Kevin Munoz, a campaign spokesman, who said Trump's plan would mean more Chinese EV manufacturing jobs and fewer American jobs. ""Simply put: Trump had the United States losing the EV race to China and if he had his way, the jobs of the future would be going to China,"" Munoz said. Some elected Republicans at the state level are approaching EVs with decidedly more nuance, which can complicate Democrats' messaging efforts. Brian Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia and a Trump adversary, opposes the IRA. But he has touted state-level tax credits that have brought EV manufacturers in-state, and has said he wants Georgia to be the ""electric mobility capital"" of America. That means Democrats will need to work hard to illustrate the role their legislation played in EV development in the state, said Wendy Davis, a Democrat from Rome, Georgia, who has held multiple local positions. Engel, the Democratic congressional candidate in Arizona, is facing off against Republican Representative Juan Ciscomani in 2024. Ciscomani has been the target of attack ads in recent months related to his opposition to the IRA, paid for by Climate Power and the League of Conservation Voters. Still, Ciscomani, who did not respond to comment requests, has generally welcomed individual EV projects, and toured a local EV plant in August. ""We will be talking about my opponent's votes against these investments,"" Engel said."

The governor's office of the world's smallest state gave no financial details of the deal in a statement but said would involve medium- and long-term leasing of Volkswagen and Skoda cars. It said the ""partnership accord"" with the Volkswagen Group (VOWG_p.DE) was one of the ways the 108-acre sovereign city-state aims to reach a long-term goal of becoming carbon neutral and relying exclusively on renewable energy. The Vatican's fleet of cars includes dozens of vehicles, most of them dark blue. A pool of drivers take senior Vatican officials to events in Rome and beyond. The fleet also includes many maintenance, gardening and delivery vehicles. Many lower-ranking Vatican officials and employees own and drive their own cars into the city-state from Rome. The statement said the Vatican would build a network of electric charging stations inside its walls and at its properties in Rome. Employees will be allowed to use them for their private cars, apparently as an incentive to move away from fossil fuels. The pope currently is driven inside the Vatican and around Rome in either a Ford Focus or a Fiat 500, both of them simple versions. He has shunned the large, gas-guzzling bulletproof limousines favoured by his predecessors. It was not clear if the deal with Volkswagen eventually will cover the ""popemobiles"", the specially built, high, white vehicles which transport the pope through crowds in St. Peter's Square. One currently in use is a Mercedes. Francis, 86, has made protection of the environment a hallmark of his papacy and often has called for a transition away from fossil fuels."
https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/electric-car-demand-set-stall-europes-valley-death-2023-11-13/,Reuters,middle,EV demand in Europe to slow as customers await affordable electric cars,Victoria Waldersee and Nick Carey,11/14/2023,"After years of accelerating growth, Europe's electric car sales appear to be entering a go-slow zone as drivers wait for better, cheaper models that are two to three years down the road. Fully-electric sales in Europe were up 47% in the first nine months of 2023, but instead of celebrating, automakers including Tesla (TSLA.O), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Mercedes-Benz (MBGn.DE) sounded a sombre note. High interest rates and a subdued market are putting customers off, they warned, with Volkswagen's EV order intake half what it was last year. Dealers in Germany and Italy as well as research by four global data analysis firms say there is more behind the slower uptake than economic uncertainty, with the consumers unconvinced that EVs meet their safety, range and price needs. ""The main problem is uncertainty,"" said Thomas Niedermayer, head of a 45-year-old family-owned Bavarian car dealership. ""Many assume that the technology will improve and would rather wait three years for the next model than buy a vehicle now that will quickly lose value."" Take Flavia Garcia and Tom Carvell in Edinburgh, Scotland. Their 15-year-old hand-me-down Toyota Auris, nicknamed Martina, needs replacing. With a petrol and diesel car ban nearing, the couple would consider an EV, but are put off by a lack of charging infrastructure, battery life fears and price. AutoTrader says new EVs in Britain are still on average 33% more expensive than fossil-fuel models. And most new models in the pipeline targeting entry-level consumers will not hit the market before 2025 at the earliest – by which time they will be contending with an expanded Chinese line-up from BYD (002594.SZ) to Nio (9866.HK) in Europe. ""You want to do the right thing for the environment, but it feels like you're setting yourself up for a very expensive investment that will make your life that bit more complicated,"" Garcia, a 29-year-old corporate media director, said. ""We'll probably get a hybrid first"". FALLING BEHIND Critics have long warned that a lack of affordable EVs would eventually stall the steep sales growth boosted by early adopters and corporate fleets. A weaker performance in September, consumer sentiment surveys and bleak commentary from carmakers and dealers indicates that low growth era may have arrived. U.S. automakers, though further behind on the transition to EVs, are also feeling the pinch. Ford and GM warned recently they were delaying the launch of cheaper EV models and pulling back on spending due to weaker demand and higher costs in the wake of new United Auto Worker contracts. But the problem is cyclical. Demand will remain slow for as long as there are no cheaper EVs available, Felipe Munoz of JATO Dynamics said of the slowdown in sales in Europe in September. ""From a regulatory standpoint, they don't have to push product out right now - they can afford to focus on profitability,"" said Alistair Bedwell, head of powertrain forecasting at GlobalData (DATA.L). ""But they need to have an eye on Tesla and the Chinese brands, because they don't want to get too far behind."" Intention to buy an EV has stayed constant in Germany over the past year, a poll by consumer research firm The Langston Co showed - meaning that although the number of EVs being sold is rising, the number of people wanting to buy an EV is not. Growing sales may simply be a sign that carmakers who were struggling to produce EVs because of supply chain bottlenecks can finally meet backed up orders, rather than a sign of rising demand, said The Langston Co's insights manager Ben DuCharme. Philip Nothard, insight director at dealer services firm Cox Automotive, said low residual values also put buyers off as companies and many consumers choose new cars based on what they can sell them for a few years down the line. ""We call it the valley of death, which we will be going through in 2024 to 2027: low residual values, high supply, and low demand,"" Nothard added."
https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-says-us-should-adopt-tougher-fuel-efficiency-rules-2023-10-17/,Reuters,middle,Tesla urges US to adopt much tougher fuel efficiency rules,David Shepardson,10/17/2023,"Electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (TSLA.O) on Tuesday urged the Biden administration to finalize much tougher fuel economy standards through 2032 than U.S. regulators have proposed. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in July proposed raising Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) car requirements by 2% and by 4% for trucks and SUVs annually between 2027 and 2032. Tesla wants the agency to finalize rules increasing stringency for cars by 6% annually and 8% for trucks and SUVs, saying it would best ""conserve energy and address climate change."" The NHTSA's proposal would result in a fleet-wide average fuel efficiency of 58 miles (93 km) per gallon by 2032. Tesla's position puts it sharply at odds with major automakers. On Monday a group representing General Motors (GM.N), Toyota Motor (7203.T), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and nearly all other major automakers sharply criticized NHTSA's proposal, saying it is unreasonable and requested significant revisions. The American Automotive Policy Council, a group representing the Detroit Three automakers, separately urged NHTSA to halve its proposed fuel economy increases to 2% annually for trucks, saying the proposal ""would disproportionately impact the truck fleet."" The group noted 83% of vehicles produced by Ford (F.N), GM and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI) are trucks. NHTSA said in response its rule ""is focused on saving Americans money at the gas pump and strengthening American energy independence"" and estimated the combined benefits of the proposal exceed costs by more than $18 billion. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation said last month automakers would face more than $14 billion in non-compliance penalties between 2027 and 2032. Toyota said on Tuesday the fines are ""proof that there is insufficient technology to meet the proposed standards and that such standards have been set beyond maximum feasible."" U.S. automakers separately have warned the fines would cost GM $6.5 billion, Stellantis $3.1 billion and Ford $1 billion, citing NHTSA's projections. Automakers also raised alarm at the Energy Department's proposal to significantly revise how it calculates the petroleum-equivalent fuel economy rating for EVs in NHTSA's CAFE program, saying it would ""devalue the fuel economy of electric vehicles by 72%."""
https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/britain-sets-out-zero-emission-timetable-carmakers-2023-09-28/,Reuters,middle,UK confirms zero-emission car timetable despite shift on target for hybrids,Alistair Smout and Sachin Ravikumar,9/28/2023,"Britain announced on Thursday it was sticking to a previous timetable to phase out cars that burn fossil fuels by 2035, limiting the impact of last week's five-year delay to a requirement that petrol and diesel cars have hybrid engines. The announcement means that last week's policy change will not cause as much disruption to the industry as some manufacturers had feared when it was announced by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a major speech. Only 20 percent of vehicles produced between 2030 and 2035 will be able to burn petrol or diesel at all, so Sunak's move to lift the requirement that they be hybrids will now affect only a small part of the fleet. ""Our mandate provides certainty for manufacturers, benefits drivers by providing more options and helps grow the economy,"" transport minister Mark Harper said. Sunak's announcement that he was moving the 2030 ban on non-hybrid fossil-fuel models to 2035 was greeted with dismay by many in the industry who said it created uncertainty and could lead to supply chain disruptions. But the government timetable unveiled on Thursday showed there will be no change in the previous schedule for increasing the share of vehicles that produce no emissions at all. Under the so-called zero emission vehicles (ZEV) mandate, which will now be retained, 22% of carmakers' sales next year must be electric, rising in increments to 80% electric in 2030 - and eventually reaching 100% in 2035. Industry experts had said keeping the previous ZEV would mean Sunak's changes on hybrids were likely to end up having only a marginal impact on car production. ""Ford has backed plans for a UK zero-emission vehicle mandate because it provides a strong investment signal to infrastructure providers to accelerate installation of new charge points,"" Ford's (F.N) UK chair Lisa Brankin said in a statement. Clarity on the targets was welcomed across the auto industry. ""With less than 100 days to go, manufacturers finally have clarity on what they are required to sell next year and up to 2030,"" Mike Hawes, CEO of car industry group the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said in a statement. ""It is worth noting the mandate means the UK still retains the most ambitious transition timeline of any major market but without any private consumer incentives."" Campaigners have said the government was sending mixed signals by instructing manufacturers to ramp up zero-emission vehicle production while also giving consumers more time to transition away from petrol and diesel cars. The government also stuck to its previous target of 70% electric van sales by 2030 and 100% by 2035, although it softened some targets for the next three years. ""The Government is sending mixed messages in a crucial policy area,"" said Ian Plummer, commercial director at UK online car marketplace Auto Trader (AUTOA.L). ""The key now will be to support consumers in making the switch."""
https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/battery-test-race-work-out-what-used-evs-are-really-worth-2023-10-23/,Reuters,middle,Focus: The battery test race to work out what used EVs are really worth,Nick Carey and Paul Lienert,10/24/2023,"A race is on to certify battery health and performance in used electric vehicles, with a clutch of startups scrambling to help buyers figure out how much a secondhand EV is really worth. With traditional combustion-engine cars, mileage and years racked up can quickly tell prospective buyers how much they should fork out. That formula does not work with EVs - whose value depends largely on their battery's driving range and ability to hold a charge. Until recently, there was no way to measure battery health, hampering used EV sales. But that is changing as companies rush to scale up EV battery tests - some of which take just minutes. One of them is Altelium, a UK startup that has a developed an EV battery state-of-health test and certificate launching this year in more than 7,000 U.S. car dealers and over 5,000 UK dealers through dealer service providers including Assurant and GardX. ""If the second-hand car market doesn't work properly, the new car market doesn't work properly and the electric transition won't happen,"" said Alex Johns, business development manager at Altelium, which says it has received interest from other markets including China. ""We're in an implementation race."" A battery typically makes up around 40% of a new EV's price. How that battery is treated is key. Charging an EV rapidly too often, constantly charging when the battery is nearly full or leaving it for long periods fully charged can degrade its battery more quickly. Austrian startup Aviloo, which has developed a test for dealers and private individuals, has found that after 100,000 kilometres (62,140 miles) EV battery health can vary by up to 30%. A consumer who wants a used EV with 90% of its range when new could end up buying one with just 70% because of the previous owner's bad charging habits - which should potentially shave thousands of euros off its value, said Marcus Berger, CEO of Aviloo. ""With an EV, mileage and age don't tell you anything,"" said Berger. ""It's all about the battery."" CRITICAL INFORMATION Automakers provide in-vehicle EV range information that critics say is often excessively rosy, making independent tests vital. A lack of visibility has hurt the EV market. According to EV battery tracking startup Recurrent, U.S. used EV prices in September were down 32% year-on-year, versus a 7% drop for fossil-fuel models. UK used EV prices were down 23% year-on-year in August while those of fossil-fuel models were up at least 4%, according to AutoTrader, which cited ""consumer concerns around battery life in used EVs"" as cause for concern. A price war started by Tesla has also weighed on used EV prices. AutoTrader and Deutsche Automobil Treuhand data show residual values for three-year old EVs in the UK and Germany are over 10 percentage points lower than fossil-fuel equivalents. ""Knowing the capacity of that (EV) battery is going to be critical,"" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of Mobility R&D at Atlanta-based Cox Automotive, which owns Manheim, the world's largest used-vehicle auction house. Driverama, an EV-focused unit of Aures Holdings, which buys around 100,000 used cars in Germany annually for sale across central Europe, uses Aviloo to weed out EVs below 80% battery capacity or with battery defects, said CEO Eldar Vagabov. 'RELIABLE NOT RUBBISH' For Michael Willvonseder, 38, an independent battery test was essential before spending 31,000 euros ($32,820) on a 2014 seven-seater Tesla Model S with 240,000 km on it. The resident of Wiener Neustadt, south of Vienna, used Aviloo and found the battery had 90% of its original capacity - with a range of 412 km versus 456 km when new. ""I want a car that's reliable, not rubbish, and I need it to last a long time,"" Willvonseder said. The race to properly value used EVs is becoming urgent because of a looming influx of vehicles. In Europe, for instance, more than 1.2 million new fully-electric cars were sold in 2021 - and many will hit the used market in 2024 when their lease contracts end. If used prices remain low, that could hurt new EV prices. ""You need a high functioning used-car market for residuals on new cars to be good,"" said Scott Case, CEO of Seattle-based Recurrent, which has signed up 20,000 EV owners to track battery data, and is also working with Black Book and dealers. Owners who care for their batteries could earn a ""potential premium of thousands of dollars"" when selling, Case said. Startups face competition from German certification agency TUV Rheinland, which operates in 60 countries. It has launched Battery Quick Check - jointly developed with startup Twaice - in car workshops across Germany and expects to launch in other markets next year. ""People just want less risk,"" when buying a used EV, said Battery Quick Check managing director Katharina Alamo Alonso."
https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/nissan-invest-14-bln-build-two-new-ev-models-britain-2023-11-24/,Reuters,middle,Nissan leads $2.5 billion investment to build two more EVs in UK,Nick Carey,11/24/2023,"Nissan (7201.T) said on Friday it would pump 1.12 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) into its British plant to build electric versions of two models, offering a boost to the country's auto industry and a prime minister desperate to attract foreign investment. The Japanese automaker said its plans for electric versions of the Qashqai and Juke, produced in Sunderland, northeast England, would require a total investment of up to 2 billion pounds, including a third battery plant in Britain and infrastructure projects that partners would help to finance. The project is expected to receive government support. Nissan has made its electric Leaf model in Sunderland for years and will continue to do so, with batteries supplied by a small plant at the site. It announced a $1.4 billion investment in 2021 to build a second, 9 gigawatt-hour (GWh) battery plant in Sunderland with Chinese partner Envision AESC. The deal fires the starting gun on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Global Investment Summit next week, when he will try to revive interest from overseas companies which, following Brexit in 2016 and political turmoil since, have cooled on Britain. ""Making the UK the best place to do business is at the heart of our economic plan,"" Sunak said in a statement on Friday. Nissan did not comment on the value of any subsidies or guarantees being provided by Britain. ""Government support is always important,"" Nissan's senior vice president manufacturing and supply chain Alan Johnson told BBC radio. ""Discussions are ongoing with the government, (and are) not concluded."" Sunak will host Nissan President and chief executive Makoto Uchida at the summit next week. Nissan's investment will help support 7,000 workers in Sunderland and 30,000 people in the supply chain, building on a presence in Britain which dates back to 1986. For the Japanese company, Britain is a key hub. Its 2021 battery investment was a show of confidence when other foreign investors were avoiding the UK after Brexit triggered years of uncertainty around its trading relationships. But Sunak, who became prime minister a year ago, is having some success turning that around. The Nissan deal comes just months after India's Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) said it would invest 4 billion pounds in a UK electric vehicle (EV) battery plant to supply its Jaguar Land Rover factories. Nissan plans to offer only fully electric cars in Europe by 2030, adding it would announce the names of the new EV models and timings for production launches at a later date. The automaker's investment in EVs comes despite the five year delay to a ban on sales of new petrol cars which Sunak announced in September."
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-66871457,BBC,middle,Rishi Sunak delays petrol car ban in major shift on green policies,Sam Francis,9/21/2023,"Rishi Sunak has delayed a ban on new petrol and diesel cars in a major change to the government's approach to achieving net zero by 2050. The prime minister announced exemptions and delays to several key green policies, alongside a 50% increase in cash incentives to replace gas boilers. The government could not impose ""unacceptable costs"" linked to reducing emissions on British families, he said. It's prompted fierce criticism from the opposition and some industry bosses. Mr Sunak also faced attacks from his own party, but many Conservative MPs came out in favour of the new direction, alongside some in the car industry. The changes come as Mr Sunak seeks to create dividing lines with opposition parties ahead of a general election, expected next year. Framing the changes as ""pragmatic and proportionate"", the prime minister has unpicked several of Boris Johnson's key policies, many of them launched when Mr Sunak was serving as chancellor. Follow live coverage as Sunak defends green policy shift Chris Mason: PM gambles as he walks towards blizzard of criticism What does net zero mean? Cars, boilers and other key takeaways from Sunak's speech In a speech from Downing Street on Wednesday, Mr Sunak said moving too fast on green policies ""risks losing the consent of the British people"". Among the key changes announced were: A five-year delay in the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars, meaning a requirement for all new cars to be ""zero emission"" will not come into force until 2035 A nine-year delay in the ban on new fossil fuel heating for off-gas-grid homes to 2035 Raising the Boiler Upgrade Grant by 50% to £7,500 to help households who want to replace their gas boilers The ban on the sale of new gas boilers in 2035 remains, but the government will introduce new exemption for poorer households Scrapping the requirement on landlords to ensure all rental properties had a Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) of grade C or higher, from 2025. Mr Sunak ran the changes past a hastily organised cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, after proposals were revealed by the BBC. Responding to the statement, Labour unequivocally committed itself to keeping the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Shadow environment secretary Steve Reed said without the ban the UK would miss its target to hit net zero - this is the point at which a country is no longer adding to the overall amount of harmful greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Mr Reed said the prime minster had ""sold out the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st Century"" for Britain ""to lead the world in transition to well-paid secured new jobs of the green economy"". Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf told the BBC the move was ""utterly unforgiveable"" and ""very firmly takes the UK out of the global consensus"". Speaking from a UN summit on climate action, which Mr Sunak had declined to attend, Mr Yousaf said: ""The same day the whole world is gathered to talk about what more we can do, we have a UK prime minister rolling back on [the UK's] commitments."" The BBC's Chris Mason says Mr Sunak and his advisers will hope that beyond the criticism, many voters might quietly conclude he is onto something and being reasonable. Mr Sunak's proposals are dividing his party, Parliament, and many in the country, but the PM will be looking at Labour's lead in the opinion polls and concluding he has no choice but to gamble. And the political choices outlined in his speech preview more announcements later this autumn, as Mr Sunak promised he would set out ""a series of long term decisions"". Watch: Rishi Sunak's shift on green policies - what he said then and now Could Sunak's green review threaten UK net zero? Billions of pounds has already been invested across multiple industries, including car makers and energy firms, in preparation of the previous deadlines. Korean carmaker Kia, which has plans to launch nine new electric vehicles over the next few years, said the announcement was disappointing as it ""alters complex supply chain negotiations and product planning, whilst potentially contributing to consumer and industry confusion"". The chief executive of energy company E.On, Chris Norbury, said it was a ""misstep on many levels"", adding that it was a ""false argument"" to suggest green policies can only come at a cost. ""We risk condemning people to many more years of living in cold and draughty homes that are expensive to heat, in cities clogged with dirty air from fossil fuels, missing out on the economic regeneration this ambition brings,"" Mr Norbury said. Jaguar Land Rover, which announced hundreds of new jobs in the West Midlands a few days ago, welcomed the change, calling it ""pragmatic"" and adding that it brings the UK in line with other nations. ""Pragmatic"" was also how Toyota described the changes. Elsewhere, Mr Sunak also suggested he would be ""scrapping"" a range of proposals which had been ""thrown up"" by the debate, including hiking up air fares to discourage foreign holidays and taxes on meat consumption. Neither of these had been government policy. Mr Sunak argued that without transparency and ""honest debate"" on the impact of green policies there would be a ""backlash"" against net zero. But Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey accused Mr Sunak of being ""selfish"" and said the changes ""epitomise his weakness"". ""The prime minister's legacy will be the hobbling of our country's future economy as he ran scared from the right wing of his own party,"" he said. The UK was now ""at the back of the queue as the rest of the world races to embrace the industries of tomorrow"", Sir Ed added. Speaking to the BBC from the UN's Climate Action Summit, Sir Alok Sharma, a former Conservative minister who chaired the COP26 climate summit, said the response from international colleagues at the event had been one of ""consternation"". ""My concern is whether people now look to us and say, 'Well, if the UK is starting to row back on some of these policies, maybe we should do the same',"" he said. Also speaking from the summit, former US vice president and climate campaigner Al Gore said the announcement marked a ""turn back in the wrong direction"". ""At times in the past, the UK has been one of the impressive leaders on climate. And so for those who have come to expect that from the UK, it's a particular disappointment,"" he told the BBC. Chris Stark, chief executive of the UK's independent Climate Change Committee, said the changes would make it harder for the government to meet legally binding climate goals. Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, Mr Stark added that the committee had already advised the government in June that it ""didn't look like we were on track"" to meet 2030 emissions targets, before these changes were announced. However, the shift in policy has gained support from some within Mr Sunak's party. Former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg backed the changes, telling the BBC: ""The problem with net zero and having regulations coming in so quickly was that it was a scheme of the elite on the backs of the least well off."" Mr Sunak is instead ""going with the grain of the nation and moving for 'intelligent net zero' by 2050 but not putting in costly bans in the next few years."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67634706,BBC,middle,EU to delay tariffs on UK electric cars until 2027,Michael Race & Simon Jack,12/6/2023,"Tariffs on electric vehicles traded between the UK and EU will be delayed for three years, the European Commission has proposed. It comes after carmakers on both sides of the Channel warned they were not ready for the change to post-Brexit trade rules planned from January. The rules were meant to protect the EU car industry, but the 10% tariffs were likely to lead to huge costs. EU member states still need to approve the plan at a meeting next week. The Commission had initially rejected the idea delaying the rules, despite pleas from carmakers and the UK government. But on Wednesday, the Commission said the ""one-off extension"" was needed to support the bloc's car industry, which was still struggling with the impacts of the pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and competition from US subsidies. Under EU ""rules of origin"" that were due to come in from January, cars produced in either the EU or UK would need to have been largely made from locally sourced parts to qualify as being tariff free. The aim was to protect the European industry from cheap imports from countries such as China, which has become a dominant force in the global electric vehicle (EV) market. Electric car rules could cost carmakers billions Battery firm Britishvolt buyer fails to pay staff But in terms of cross-Channel trade, the rules would have meant that EVs needed to have batteries produced in either the UK or the EU, and many carmakers warned they would struggle to meet the criteria. The pace of local battery production has been slower than expected, leaving manufacturers reliant on imports. Heavy costs Industry bodies raised concerns that the rules would cost European manufacturers £3.75bn over the next three years. There were also fears that steep tariffs could make electric cars more expensive to produce and potentially push up prices. The UK government had been lobbying the EU to postpone the rules. While the Commission's move will not be a huge surprise, carmakers will be relieved on both sides of the Channel given the tariffs were due to come in from January. The UK is by far the largest export market for European manufacturers, with 1.2 million vehicles being delivered to UK ports last year. At the same time the UK sells more cars to the EU than any other region. Although it has proposed a three-year delay to the rules, the European Commission said it would add a clause to the Brexit trade deal making it ""legally impossible"" for the extension to last any longer. This, it said, would lock in its rules of origin from 2027. The Commission also said it would provide €3bn in funding over the next three years to help boost European battery manufacturers. The new deadline places UK electric car production in the spotlight, with plans for so-called gigafactories, such as Jaguar Land Rover's in Somerset, being announced, but none close to producing batteries yet. Doubts also remain over a site in Blyth in Northumberland which has been earmarked for making car batteries."
https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231204-why-us-drivers-may-be-thinking-about-evs-all-wrong,BBC,middle,Why US drivers may be thinking about EVs all wrong,Kate Morgan,12/6/2023,"Americans have specific expectations for their cars. Do EVs need to evolve to meet their demands – or are consumers' perceptions miscalibrated? While electric vehicle sales in the United States are rising, demand has slowed. According to a July 2023 Pew Research Center survey, half of Americans say they're unlikely to consider an EV, and 13% are sure they don't want one. In fact, according to the report, the share of the public interested in purchasing an EV is down 4% from May 2022. Analysts point to affordability issues and lack of confidence in charging infrastructure as the main drivers, but car manufacturers also face another challenge to convince consumers to ditch the combustion engine: US drivers don't believe a new electric auto could be a wholesale replacement for their current car. It's not that Americans are opposed to EVs, per se – it's rather that an overwhelming swath of consumers want EVs that can take them as far on a single charge as they can get on a tank of gas. And in a country where the top-selling vehicles are pickup trucks and large SUVs, buyers are less likely to downsize to go electric. Right now, says Chris Hopson, a principal analyst at S&P Global Mobility, for most consumers switching to an EV would mean a change of lifestyle. It's a switch many seem unwilling to make. ""Beyond affordability, the next thing is, 'I want my lifestyle not to change because of my vehicle',"" he says. A demand for road-trip readiness Driving range is among the biggest sticking points Americans cite for their EV-buying hesitancy: a May 2023 Bloomberg survey showed American drivers want their EV to go at least 300 miles (482km) on a single charge, and fewer than 10% would settle for a car that couldn't go at least 200 miles (322km). While EV range has more than doubled since the first vehicles were introduced over a decade ago, most have not hit that 300 miles benchmark. And even EVs that tout a possible range above 250 miles (402km) may not actually get that far in practice. Things like using heat or air conditioning, driving in rain or into a headwind, driving at higher speeds or sitting in stop-and-go traffic can all considerably reduce that range. Some research shows the electric Hummer emits as much or more greenhouse gas as a standard-sized sedan (Credit: Getty Images) The fixation on mileage may be misplaced, however, given Americans don't actually tend to go all that far when they get behind the wheel. A 2022 study from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics showed more than half of all daily trips – by any mode of transportation – were fewer than 3 miles (4.8km). In fact, only 2% were longer than 50 miles (80.4km). Perhaps the idea of the open road is too strong to compel drivers to settle: even if most travel is just around town, Americans want to know they could set out on an epic road trip if they wanted. Hopson also points to lack of consumer confidence in charging. Charger infrastructure and dependability has lagged, and Hopson says Americans would rather know their vehicle can do several hundred miles at a time than risk being stranded. ""If you don't have home charging,"" he says, ""there's issues around road trips, and how to charge, where to charge or when to charge."" Buyers may simply be waiting, he says, ""for the next generation of batteries that are all quick-charging"", or for charging infrastructure that guarantees a working charger at least every 200 miles or so. A recent S&P analysis showed that among people who do make the switch to an EV, some feel considerable disappointment. The survey – which did not include the drivers of Telsas, which dominate the market ­– showed nearly half of households who own a non-Tesla EV decide to buy a gas-powered car next. Bigger's still better On Car and Driver's 2022 list of the best-selling vehicles in the United States, half of the top ten – including spots one and two – were large pick-up trucks. The popularity of trucks and large SUVs has remained steady in the United States, and EV options in those segments remain limited. The ones that have hit the market have come with some considerable drawbacks. Sales of the Ford F-150 Lightning Electric Truck were promising, but have slowed (Credit: Alamy) ""They've created [some] electric vehicles and said, 'you can do 350 miles in this, you can go off-roading, it's as big a vehicle as you want and you can fit this many people in it',"" says Hopson. ""The technology is a wonderment, but the engineering means the battery has to be this big, it has to weigh this much and the cost is this much. The reality is they're just guzzling in a different way, from an energy perspective."" The most noable example of this may be GM's reissue of the Hummer, a large SUV that was discontinued in its combustion-engine iteration, in 2010. The new EV version, which claims a range up to 381 miles (613km), weighs nearly 10,000lbs (4,539kg). The battery alone weighs as much as an entire Toyota Corolla. Between the lithium needed to power the battery and the energy grid use to charge it, non-profit research group American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy found that the Hummer EV emits as much or more greenhouse gas as a standard-sized sedan. While other larger EVs, like Ford's F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck, showed early promise and popularity, sales have slowed to a crawl as consumers find that using an EV truck the way they use a gas or diesel-powered one – towing, for instance – can cut the truck's range by a third or more. Many Americans are simply waiting for a better EV option in the truck or vehicle category, or perhaps waiting for a certain manufacturer to release an EV version of a specific model, says Russell Hensley, co-lead of the Center for Future Mobility in the Americas at consulting firm McKinsey & Company. ""You haven't got the full suite of vehicle choice at this point,"" he says. And in the meantime, a big ""percentage are thinking, well, we'll just take one more internal combustion engine before we pivot"". Americans want EVs to replace their large cars, which they have a strong preference for driving (Credit: Alamy) A wave of change on the horizon Whether or not cars that check Americans' boxes eventually enter the market, adoption will eventually rise, says Hensley, and EVs will take over. The wave of change is coming, he says, and generational differences when it comes to embracing that wave are unignorable. In a recent McKinsey and Co survey, millennials – respondents between the ages of 25 and 40 – said they were three times as likely as Baby Boomers (people older than 56) to switch car brands for something that offered better connectivity, and seven-times as likely to switch for better autonomous driving features. Essentially, says Hensley, the results speak to Baby Boomers' resistance to change, and unwillingness to let brand new technology alter their lifestyle, especially compared to younger people. ""I think there is a fundamental difference there just in terms of expectations out of a vehicle,"" he says. Younger consumers, on the other hand, are more open to a paradigm shift in the way they think about driving. In other words, they might not expect an EV to do everything a gas-powered car can do. They might be open, instead, to shaping their lives around the tech, rather than expecting the tech to fit their existing lifestyle. ""Right now, the people who can most easily go out and buy an EV,"" says Hensley, referring to the Baby Boomers, who currently control 70% of the disposable income in the US, ""are the ones with the least willingness to change"". Of course, that won't always be the case. As the buying power of millennials and younger generations grows, EV market share will too, he says. The big unanswered question, he adds, is whether it's really the cars that need to evolve in the meantime, or Americans' expectations. ""Let's say you get to the point where you can have all the attributes that you've had historically with an internal combustion engine,"" he says. ""The question becomes more whether you actually need them, or whether you begin to change your behaviour."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67517522,BBC,middle,Nissan to lead £2bn investment in UK electric car plant,Theo Leggett & Tom Espiner,11/24/2023,"Nissan and its partners have announced a £2bn plan to build three electric car models at its Sunderland factory. The Japanese firm will build electric Qashqai and Juke models at the plant alongside the next generation of the electric Leaf, which is already produced there. The scheme could help preserve the jobs of about 6,000 workers directly, and thousands more across the UK. Nissan said that alongside this, a major new battery plant known as a ""gigafactory"" will also be needed. This is in addition to the current factory adjacent to the car plant, and a further gigafactory already being built by its partner, AESC. Nissan will spend £1.12bn on preparing its UK facilities and supply chain for the new models and training its workforce. Alongside the gigafactory the total new investment will be up to £2bn, according to the company. Lei Zhang, chairman of AESC, said the firm had launched a feasibility study on expanding its gigafactory operations in Sunderland. The plan is expected to receive government support, though it is not clear what form that will take. Nissan has confirmed it will receive £15m in funding for its research centre in Bedfordshire. The Unite union said the plan ""secures the long-term future of the site and the thousands of skilled well-paid jobs it supports"", but called for more government support for the car industry. Earlier this year, Nissan's chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta, who has since left the firm, said that the UK would struggle to remain competitive with other car-making countries because of higher manufacturing costs, elevated by energy bills and inflation. Alan Johnson, Nissan's senior vice president of manufacturing and supply chain, told the BBC's Today programme that the UK ""can be a competitive place for car production, but everything needs to be right"". ""Not just the plant itself, but the surrounding environment: energy costs, infrastructure, local government [and] national government support, needs to be right for it to work,"" he said. The UK government has provided support for Nissan through the Automotive Transformation Fund, which received a £2bn top-up in the Autumn Statement on Wednesday. Mr Johnson declined to comment on how much funding the company has received from UK taxpayers. He said: ""The support we have received in the past has been excellent and we're very grateful for the support we do receive. ""The truth is discussions are ongoing with the government, not concluded, and therefore I'm not in a position at the moment to make any announcement or any comment about any numbers."" The government's contribution to Nissan's project is understood to be about £100m, and if the gigafactory goes ahead, the funding for that will also be about £100m. Nissan's announcement comes as an ""investment zone"" for North East England was confirmed by the government. The government said it will create more than 4,000 jobs over five years. Brexit In the summer, Mr Gupta also warned that the UK's largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland would be ""unsustainable"" without a post-Brexit trade deal on tariffs. Rules due to take effect in January next year mean there will be a 10% tariff on cars sold between the UK and EU unless carmakers have sourced at least 45% of their components by value from the UK or EU. Batteries are the most expensive part of an electric vehicle, and some manufacturers in both the UK and EU have said they will struggle to meet the requirements, and have called for the rules to be deferred. Mr Johnson said that Nissan exports 80% of the vehicles made at its Sunderland plant, ""so of course exportation is critical to our success"". ""In terms of the Brexit deal, we're just getting on with it,"" he said, adding that the key to Nissan's strategy is ""having your major investments like battery production in the UK"". Other car makers have also expressed concerns about the tariffs. In May, Stellantis, which owns Vauxhall, Peugeot, Citroen and Fiat, said it may have to close UK factories if the government did not renegotiate the Brexit deal. The firm has made a commitment to making electric cars in the UK, but said that if the cost ""becomes uncompetitive and unsustainable, operations will close"". The AESC plant in Sunderland is the only one in the UK currently making electric vehicle batteries, but Jaguar Land Rover owner Tata plans to build a £4bn factory in Somerset. Some battery firms have had problems setting up in the UK. Britishvolt, which planned to make batteries in the North East, went into administration earlier this year. It was taken over by Australian firm Recharge Industries, but that hasn't gone smoothly either, with £2.5m of the purchase price still unpaid months after it was due. By contrast the EU has 35 plants open, under construction or planned. In September Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a major shift in UK green policy by delaying a ban on new petrol and diesel cars by five years, to 2035. Nissan said in September it would not change its timetable, and that it would stick to manufacturing electric vehicles only by 2030. The firm's boss Makoto Uchida said at the time it was the right thing to do for its business, customers and for the planet. Postponing the ban has had a knock-on effect on the number of electric vehicles expected to be sold in the UK by 2027. The government's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said on Wednesday that just 38% of new vehicles sold in the UK in 2027 would be electric, lower than the 67% it predicted in March."
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-67483562,BBC,middle,Jobs at risk over insufficient electric vehicle battery production in UK,,11/21/2023,"Hundreds of thousands of jobs could be at risk if electric vehicle (EV) battery production in the UK does not increase, cross-party MPs have warned. Decisive action is needed to attract investment in UK gigafactories, warns the Business and Trade Committee. Their report forecast the UK will need 100GWh (gigawatt hours) of battery manufacturing capacity by 2030. The UK's only existing gigafactory, the Nissan-owned Envision AESC in Sunderland, has 2GWh of capacity. According to the group of MPs, the UK is on course to produce around half the battery capacity likely to be required in future by the UK's domestic car industry alone. ""Satisfying demand from the UK's automotive industry and other sectors will require 100GWh (Gigawatt hours) of battery manufacturing capacity by 2030,"" the report states. ""That requirement will increase to 200GWh by 2040. ""At best, announced plans satisfy a little over half the capacity the nation needs by 2030."" Failure to attract more investment could lead to a decline in the UK car industry, potentially putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk, say MPs. PA Media Britishvolt's site in Cambois, near BlythPA Media Gigafactory start-up Britishvolt, which owned a site in Northumberland, went bust in January Many of the world's gigafactories, where batteries are produced, are currently in China. Labour MP Liam Byrne, who chairs the committee, said: ""We risk the industry simply relocating to Europe or the US or becoming reliant on imports from China and elsewhere. ""That imperils 160,000 jobs and a jewel in the UK's industrial crown. Now is the time to act."" The parliamentary committee contends the UK could become a ""frontrunner"" in building ""sustainable and ethical batteries"". The government has said new funding for the UK car industry and battery production will be unveiled later this week. A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said: ""In the past few months, the government has secured a £4bn investment from Tata in a new gigafactory, and £600m to build the next generation of electric Minis. ""Later this week we will publish a wide-ranging Advanced Manufacturing Plan and the UK's first Battery Strategy, both of which will ensure we continue to place the UK at the forefront of global supply chains."" In 2021, Nissan announced a major expansion of electric vehicle production at the plant in Sunderland as part of a £1bn investment. Last year, the factory launched its own onsite EV battery assembly line for the electric version of the Qashqai and Juke, two of the plant's most successful models. "

The first of the chargers are due to be installed in Norwich next month. Rachael Andrews of Inclusive Norwich said the position of the devices ""affects everyone who needs to use the pavement"". Norfolk County Council said it delayed the installation while feedback from the public was taken on board. The first installations are due to begin on 11 December and will see 66 chargers installed at 33 of the 46 locations originally proposed across the city. 'Obstacles' Ms Andrews said the main concerns of the group were about access for people with physical and sensory disabilities. She said: ""I'm blind, I have a guide dog and when you're talking about things that are installed in the footway, for me, it's a possible obstacle I may meet with my guide dog and not know how to get around. ""If you're a wheelchair user for example, you're talking about a physical obstacle that stops you passing the footway."" Although the charging units are at the kerbside, there are worries it may infringe on the pavement and that charging cables may be coiled or left lying in the pavement. Feedback was given to the council and Ms Andrews said she recognised the team were trying their best, but said she was unsure the concerns had been considered. She said: ""Our principal concern, when it comes down to it, is of safety and with regards to cables being obstacles preventing people accessing the foot way, or being a safety issue if we don't see it. ""And really it's not just about disabled people in this instance.. so in this situation safety and accessibility of the EV chargers doesn't just affect us, it affects everyone who needs to use the pavement. So we have got some deep concerns."" PAUL MOSELEY/BBC Pavement marked for EV chargers on Dereham Road, Norwich.PAUL MOSELEY/BBC Pavements were marked up earlier this year for the possible addition of EV chargers Norfolk County Council (NCC) previously said all proposed sites would allow at least 1m (3.3ft) of footpath for people to use. Following feedback from a public consultation, the council and contractors Blink delayed the installation and ""took on board the comments of the public where possible"", the council said. Graham Plant, NCC cabinet member for highways, infrastructure and transport said: ""The feedback we gained from our consultation was invaluable and has allowed us to reassess some of the site designs to ensure we are introducing the right infrastructure to make Norfolk fit for the future and enable people to cut their dependence on motor transport that rely on fossil fuels.""It is expected that all EV chargers will be installed by Spring 2024."
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-67232301,BBC,middle,Banbury: How are electric car chargers changing?,Paul Clifton,10/27/2023,"Around 35% of all charging points are in London, with 12% in the South East Nearly half of all public charging points for electric cars are in London and the South East - and most of those are inside London. That's changing, but what will be the effect of the government's announcement that sales of new petrol and diesel cars can continue for an extra five years, until 2035? The car charging hub near the M40 in Banbury can plug in 32 cars at once, and there are a small but growing number of these large hubs. This is what will gradually replace petrol stations - row upon row of places to plug in your car. Reflecting electric car ownership, they are concentrated in the South East. The number of public chargers has increased by 43% in a year, according to Zapmap, an app which helps motorists find charging points. After a slow start, the pace of change is picking up. In 2018, there were 10,000. Two years later there were 20,000. Today there are 50,000. And the number is expected to double again during 2025. woman with pink sunglasses on There are ""challenges"" with electric 4x4 vehicles, says Lorna McAtear The Banbury hub is run by Basingstoke company Instavolt. ""There are still a lot of myths surrounding driving electric cars,"" Chief Executive Adrian Keen says. ""There's no connection charge and no subscription - just tap your payment card to start the charge and pay for what you use."" But plugging into a charging hub still costs around six times more per kilowatt hour than charging overnight at home, according to the AA. The power is supplied from the National Grid, where Fleet Manager Lorna McAtear runs its 9,000 vehicles, of which 1,500 are fully electric. ""Ford, Nissan and other manufacturers have said they will press ahead with going all-electric by 2030,"" she points out. ""There is a challenge with the 4x4 utility market, because there aren't yet many big electric vehicles that can tow 3.5 tonnes, and we require a lot of those - but the public network is really ramping up. ""I struggle to keep up with all the new chargers going in: the number is growing exponentially each month - it is meeting demand,"" she added. Instavolt electric car chargersInstavolt Instavolt runs a public electric vehicle rapid charging network There are approaching a million electric vehicles - EVs - on our roads. That may sound a lot, but it's still only 3% of the total. That will change fast - EVs now outsell diesel cars by four to one. Although there has been a blip in retail sales, because of the rising cost of living. But half of all new electric car sales are to the company car market, and that hasn't dropped. Regardless of the government's change of deadline from 2030 to 2035 for ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars, this trend is only heading in one direction."
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67017972,BBC,middle,Electric car sales to private buyers fall sharply,Theo Leggett,10/5/2023,"Sales of new electric cars to private buyers fell sharply in September compared with the same period a year ago, latest figures show. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said sales to private buyers fell by 14%, but overall registrations of electric cars rose almost 19%. The growth was entirely driven by company fleet buyers. The car market as a whole showed strong growth in September, but sales are still below pre-pandemic levels. Overall, new car registrations grew by 21% last month compared with the same period in 2022. September is a good opportunity to gauge the health of the sector, as the issuing of new number plates significantly boosts sales. It was the 14th consecutive month of growth. The industry has been recovering from the impact of the Covid pandemic, as well as the subsequent shortage of parts - particularly semiconductors - which affected production and the availability of some models. As with electric cars, the growth in the car market has been driven by company fleets renewing their stock, with registrations up 40%. Sales to private buyers grew 5%, but the market as a whole remains significantly smaller than it was before the Covid crisis. Electric car rules could cost carmakers billions Car makers split on decision to delay petrol ban For company car drivers, electric cars attract a much lower tax bill than petrol or diesel models, and this has boosted their popularity. But there are fewer benefits for private buyers. The Plug-in Car Grant, which provided discounts on the purchase price of EV's and plug-in hybrids was withdrawn last year, while an exemption from vehicle excise duty for electric cars is due to end in 2025. For manufacturers, this is a serious concern. The government is pushing ahead with its zero-emissions vehicle mandate, despite its decision to defer a complete ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, to 2035. Under the mandate, manufacturers will be obliged to ensure that by 2030, eight out of 10 cars sold will have to be battery or hydrogen powered. That will mean a significant increase in sales to private buyers. ""With tougher EV targets for manufacturers coming into force next year, we need to accelerate the transition, encouraging all motorists to make the switch,"" said the SMMT's chief executive Mike Hawes. ""This means adding carrots to the stick - creating private purchase incentives aligned with business benefits."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66889029,BBC,middle,Electric car rules could cost carmakers billions,Theo Leggett,9/24/2023,"New Brexit trade rules covering electric vehicles could cost European manufacturers £3.75bn over the next three years, an industry body has said. The rules are meant to ensure that EU-produced electric cars are largely made from locally sourced parts. But manufacturers on both sides of the Channel say they are not ready. The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) also warned the measures could reduce output from EU factories by 480,000 vehicles. And they said customers would pay the price. The main problem lies in so-called ""rules of origin"" which come into force in January. They apply to shipments of cars across the Channel under the terms of the Brexit deal, the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement. They will effectively ensure that electric vehicles will need to have batteries produced in either the UK or the EU. Cars that do not meet the criteria will face 10% tariffs - or taxes - when transported across the Channel, in either direction. The rules were designed to protect the European industry from cheap imports. But because battery production in Europe has not ramped up as quickly as expected, carmakers are struggling to meet the new criteria. It is a serious problem for European manufacturers. The UK is by far their largest export market, with 1.2 million vehicles arriving at UK ports last year. Likewise more cars built in the UK are transported to the EU than any other region. Steep tariffs could make electric cars more expensive to produce, and potentially push up prices. The ACEA wants the new rules to be delayed for three years, and it is appealing to the European Commission to take action. ""Driving up consumer prices of European electric vehicles, at the very time when we need to fight for market share in the face of fierce international competition, is not the right move,"" said Renault chief executive Luca de Meo, who is also acting as ACEA's president. ""We will effectively be handing a chunk of the market to global manufacturers,"" he added. Firms still forced to sell more electric cars PM delays petrol car ban in shift on green policies For the rules to be pushed back, an agreement would need to be reached between the UK and the EU. The UK's Business Secretary, Kemi Badenoch, said last week she was ""optimistic"" such a deal could be reached. But in an interview with the Guardian on Friday, the EU's internal market commissioner Thierry Breton was much less forthcoming. He said it would be wrong to re-open the Brexit deal to satisfy the motor industry. ""If something has been negotiated, it shouldn't be changed,"" he told the newspaper. Getty Images Electric car charging pointGetty Images The European Commission said: ""Brexit has changed the trade relationship between the UK and the EU, among other things."" It noted that the Brexit trade deal - the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement - ""is the outcome of a negotiation in which both sides agreed to an overall balance of commitments"". It added that the rules of origin aim to develop a ""strong and resilient battery value chain in the EU"". Sigrid de Vries, the secretary general of ACEA, said it was unsurprising that the industry's appeals were meeting resistance. ""The European Commission doesn't want to change anything, it seems, when it comes to Brexit-related topics. It's politically very sensitive,"" she told the BBC. ""We do understand it, and we are not asking to change any of these arrangements in any fundamental way."" Meanwhile the chief executive of the UK's Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Mike Hawes, told reporters last week that he thought a deal would be done - but it could be a last-minute affair. ""We are still optimistic an agreement can be reached. It makes common sense,"" he said. ""But I can see this going down, like with Brexit, to Christmas Eve, or something like that."" Trade officials from the EU and the UK are due to meet this week in London. It is not yet known whether the new rules will be on the agenda."
https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66820791,BBC,middle,Chinese electric cars will reduce UK emissions but what about rivals here?,Faisal Islam,9/15/2023,"The UK is facing a dilemma: should it fight the rising imports of Chinese electric cars with big new tariffs, in the same way the EU has threatened to do this week? Or should it allow them to continue? Keeping open to the imports in would make it easier for the UK to hit its goal of no new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and it would make electric cars cheaper. But the UK car industry could be damaged. The British car industry is showing off its green electric future at a Bedfordshire racetrack, and behind the marques, some familiar, some less so, there is a new force. China is cornering the market in electric vehicles. A friendly man from Chinese firm BYD shows me the Atto. ""We're really proud of this car,"" says Mark Blundell. ""It's new to the market, and packed full of technology. In simple terms we can pack 50% more battery into less space."" The car's interior is inspired by a gym. It has a heat pump as standard, vegan leather, and strings on the door map-pocket tight enough to ""get a tune out of"". The display screen on the dashboard rotates at the press of a button. For now, hands should still be on the steering wheel, though China expects to be ahead of the game on autonomous driving too. And the all important battery life and range? Impressive. China has cornered the market in electric vehicle batteries. Indeed, many of the new car companies, including Byd, started off as battery manufacturers. BYD stands for ""Build Your Dreams"", and they are on course to overtake Tesla as the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles this year. If hybrids are included, they are already number one. Mark Blundell and Faisal Islam next to Atto car Mark Blundell (pictured left), BYD UK marketing manager, says the firm is ""really proud"" of the Atto BYD, long-backed by legendary US investor Warren Buffett, has just started selling in the UK, and recently wooed the Munich motor show with six models heading for Europe. Other Chinese brands, such as FunkyCat and Nio, are not yet as well known in Europe. There are also more-established brands, such as the Volvo-linked Polestar, and the formerly Oxford-based MG cars, which are being shipped from China. Moreover, most Teslas in the UK in recent years have been shipped from China, made in the Shanghai Gigafactory that was built in six months in 2019. In total, China has already overtaken Germany for overall global car exports, and will overtake Japan this year, becoming the world's top exporter, according to figures from Moody's Analytics. This is no accident according to Andy Palmer, the former Aston Martin and Nissan boss. ""Twenty years ago, I was sitting on the board of [Chinese carmaker] Dongfeng. It was the decree of the Chinese government that Chinese car companies needed to leapfrog over western companies and the best way of doing that was to adopt new energy vehicles, as they called them at the time. That ultimately, of course, meant battery-electric vehicles,"" he says. Getty Images Andy PalmerGetty Images Andy Palmer says electric car market dominance has been a 20-year project by the Chinese state That strategic planning for dominance in this sector meant China carved up capability on batteries, motors and the raw materials supply chains stretching across the world. Now the scale they have, combined with subsidies, mean Chinese manufacturers are able to undercut other global players, Mr Palmer says. It is also important to note that there are fundamental differences between the production of an electric vehicle and a conventional combustion engine car. Much more of the car's value is in the battery, compared to the value of the engine in relation to the rest of the car. The technology and transmission is more straightforward too. If you have the batteries, it is far easier to add wheels and the technology around it. Companies like BYD are ahead of the game when it comes to innovative battery technology, and are achieving ranges of as much as 400 miles without the use of cobalt and nickel. Both rare metals pose acute supply and environmental challenges, cobalt thanks to its connection with conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and nickel given its dependence on Russia. But the bottom line is that the cars perform well and look the part, being sold at competitive prices. As Jon Bentley, author of Autopia and presenter of the Gadget Show says: ""[Chinese imports] could really change the European market quite considerably in a way the Japanese car industry did in the 70s and 80s. ""Given that it's the price that is stopping many of us adopting electric cars, they are potentially a huge market force that we're about to discover being unleashed upon us"". Eliminating new combustion engine vehicles over the next decade is the single biggest contributor to the government's path to net zero. So cheaper Chinese models could play a big role in the same way cheaper solar panels did. On the other hand, even if tariffs are applied to Chinese imports, the European and British car industry may struggle to compete. A car industry veteran told me earlier this year that Chinese firms were ""sewing up the dealerships"". Chinese companies have chosen to expand their exports into Europe and the rest of the world, but not into the US. So it was striking and inevitable that the European Union announced a new probe into Chinese electric vehicles this week. The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said they had not forgotten how the solar industry was affected by China's ""unfair trade practices"". ""Many young businesses were pushed out by heavily-subsidised Chinese competitors. Pioneering companies had to file for bankruptcy. Global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars. And their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies. This is distorting our market,"" she said. Ursula von der Leyen Ursula von der Leyen said 'global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars' In the industry, this is seen as a mainly French push, with the Germans a little more sceptical. German industry is more invested in tie-ups with Chinese industry and its premium brands stand to suffer the most if what began this week escalates into a trade war. The Chinese government hit back, calling the investigation ""a naked protectionist act"". The process takes just over a year, and could lead to extra, even punitive tariffs, levied on car imports into Europe. It raises the question of what might happen here in the UK. The independent Trade Remedies Authority, the post-Brexit organisation responsible for assessing unfair trade, said it has ""invited"" carmakers to make a complaint and supply data showing harm done by subsidised Chinese electric vehicles. Neither the industry body, nor individual carmakers have done so, so far. But some in the industry say that if the EU were to apply punitive tariffs, then China's export drive could be refocused on the UK. The government does reserve some powers to act on trade defence issues. It is intriguing that the Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch did this week cite competition from China in her push to get the EU to delay the Brexit trade deal restrictions on the electric vehicle trade. But there is an extra twist on this issue for carmakers in Britain, which some privately describe as ""farcical"". In a few weeks' time the government will introduce its Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, designed to force carmakers down the path towards hitting targets to eliminate the sale of the combustion engine. If a car company misses its target that 22% of its sales are electric, starting in January, it will either face fines of £15,000 per vehicle, or have to buy a surplus credit from a company that has sold lots of electric vehicles. It happens to be the case that the Chinese-made import brands are mainly all electric. The net result of all this, fear some in the car industry, is a system where existing UK manufacturers, including of hybrid cars, will pay thousands of pounds to subsidise electric imports. Essentially, UK factories, which face competition from Chinese electric imports, could have to subsidise them. While this is not the intention of the policy it could be the inadvertent effect. The government has not yet published its response to a consultation on this that closed four months ago. The expectation in the industry is that sufficient flexibilities will be introduced to prevent this issue. But the system is just weeks away from being introduced. And it is clear that the general architecture of the ZEV mandate is designed to provide a carrot for electric importers, including from China, and a stick for actual producers of existing cars in the UK. Right now, the EU is looking at restricting Chinese electric vehicle sales, whereas the UK could inadvertently be subsidising them. Is this part of a conscious post-Brexit strategy to help the British consumer, with an anti-protectionist free trade approach? Does the route to mass adoption of zero carbon technologies go through Shanghai? None of this is happening in a vacuum. Apart from the commercial challenge, many in Parliament are distinctly uneasy about aiding Chinese dominance in a sector as totemic and strategic as the automotive industry. Are cars different from TVs and Iphones, or more like semi-conductors, 5G infrastructure and energy? The strategic question is how China cleaned up with two decades of long-term planning on electric cars and their batteries, on a clear and predictable consequence of a net zero agenda pushed by the G7 western nations. The more immediate question for Britain is whether we go for cheaper Chinese imports to aid mass adoption of a key net zero technology, or prioritise domestic production."
